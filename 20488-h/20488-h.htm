<h2>TO HER MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY
THE QUEEN.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>The gracious intimation of your Royal pleasure that these Memoirs of
your renowned Predecessor should be dedicated to your Majesty, while
it increases my solicitude, suggests at the same time new and cheering
anticipations. I cannot but hope that, appearing in the world under
the auspices of your great name, the religious and moral purposes
which this work is designed to serve will be more widely and
effectually realised.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Under a lively sense of the literary defects which render these
volumes unworthy of so august a patronage, to one point I may revert
with feelings of satisfaction and encouragement. I have gone
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageiv" name="pageiv">(p. iv)</a></span>
only where Truth seemed to lead me on the way: and this, in your
Majesty's judgment, I am assured will compensate for many
imperfections.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>That your Majesty may ever abundantly enjoy the riches of HIS favour
who is the Spirit of Truth, and having long worn your diadem here in
honour and peace, in the midst of an affectionate and happy people,
may resign it in exchange for an eternal crown in heaven, is the
prayer of one who rejoices in the privilege of numbering himself,</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagev" name="pagev">(p. v)</a></span>


<p>Memoirs such as these of Henry of Monmouth might doubtless be made
more attractive and entertaining were their Author to supply the
deficiencies of authentic records by the inventions of his fancy, and
adorn the result of careful inquiry into matters of fact by the
descriptive imagery and colourings of fiction. To a writer, also, who
could at once handle the pen of the biographer and of the poet, few
names would offer a more ample field for the excursive range of
historical romance than the life of Henry of Monmouth. From the day of
his first compulsory visit to Ireland, abounding as that time does
with deeply interesting incidents, to his last hour in the now-ruined
castle of Vincennes;&mdash;or rather, from his mother's espousals to the
interment of his earthly remains within the sacred precincts of
Westminster, every period teems with animating suggestions. So far,
however, from possessing such adventitious recommendations, the point
on which (rather perhaps than any other) an apology might be expected
for this work, is, that it has freely tested by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevi" name="pagevi">(p. vi)</a></span>
the standard
of truth those delineations of Henry's character which have
contributed to immortalize our great historical dramatist. The Author,
indeed, is willing to confess that he would gladly have withdrawn from
the task of assaying the substantial accuracy and soundness of
Shakspeare's historical and biographical views, could he have done so
safely and without a compromise of principle. He would have avoided
such an inquiry, not only in deference to the acknowledged rule which
does not suffer a poet to be fettered by the rigid shackles of
unbending facts; but from a disinclination also to interfere, even in
appearance, with the full and free enjoyment of those exquisite scenes
of humour, wit, and nature, in which Henry is the hero, and his
"riotous, reckless companions" are subordinate in dramatical
excellence only to himself. The Author may also not unwillingly grant,
that (with the majority of those who give a tone to the "form and
pressure" of the age) Shakspeare has done more to invest the character
of Henry with a never-dying interest beyond the lot of ordinary
monarchs, than the bare records of historical verity could ever have
effected. Still he feels that he had no alternative. He must either
have ascertained the historical worth of those scenic representations,
or have suffered to remain in their full force the deep and prevalent
impressions, as to Henry's principles and conduct, which owe, if not
their origin, yet, at least, much of their universality and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevii" name="pagevii">(p. vii)</a></span>
vividness, to Shakspeare. The poet is dear, and our early associations
are dear; and pleasures often tasted without satiety are dear: but to
every rightly balanced mind Truth will be dearer than all.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>It must nevertheless be here intimated, that these volumes are neither
exclusively, nor yet especially, designed for the antiquarian student.
The Author has indeed sought for genuine information at every
fountain-head accessible to him; but he has prepared the result of his
researches for the use (he would trust, for the improvement as well as
the gratification,) of the general reader. And whilst he has not
consciously omitted any essential reference, he has guarded against
interrupting the course of his narrative by an unnecessary
accumulation of authorities. He is, however, compelled to confess that
he rises from this very limited sphere of inquiry under an impression,
which grew stronger and deeper as his work advanced, that, before a
history of our country can be produced worthy of a place among the
records of mankind, the still hidden treasures of the metropolis and
of our universities, together with the stores which are known to exist
in foreign libraries, must be studied with far more of devoted care
and zealous perseverance than have hitherto been bestowed upon them.
That the honest and able student, however unwearied in zeal and
industry, may be supplied with the indispensable means
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageviii" name="pageviii">(p. viii)</a></span>
of
verifying what tradition has delivered down, enucleating difficulties,
rectifying mistakes, reconciling apparent inconsistencies, clearing up
doubts, and removing that mass of confusion and error under which the
truth often now lies buried,&mdash;our national history must be made a
subject of national interest. It is a maxim of our law, and the
constant practice of our courts of justice, never to admit evidence
unless it be the best which under the circumstances can be obtained.
Were this principle of jurisprudence recognised and adopted in
historical criticism, the student would carefully ascend to the first
witnesses of every period, on whom modern writers (however eloquent or
sagacious) must depend for their information. How lamentably devoid of
authority and credit is the work of the most popular and celebrated of
our modern English historians in consequence of his unhappy neglect of
this fundamental principle, will be made palpably evident by the
instances which could not be left unnoticed even within the narrow
range of these Memoirs. And the Author is generally persuaded that,
without a far more comprehensive and intimate acquaintance with
original documents than our writers have possessed, or apparently have
thought it their duty to cultivate, error will continue to be
propagated as heretofore; and our annals will abound with surmises and
misrepresentations, instead of being the guardian depositories of
historical verity. Only by the acknowledgment and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageix" name="pageix">(p. ix)</a></span>
application
of the principle here advocated will England be supplied with those
monuments of our race, those "<span class="smcap">POSSESSIONS FOR EVER</span>," as the Prince of
Historians<a id="notetag001" name="notetag001"></a><a href="#note001">[1]</a>
once named them, which may instruct the world in the
philosophy of moral cause and effect, exhibit honestly and clearly the
natural workings of the human heart, and diffuse through the mass of
our fellow-creatures a practical assurance that piety, justice, and
charity form the only sure groundwork of a people's glory and
happiness; while religious and moral depravity in a nation, no less
than in an individual, leads, (tardily it may be and remotely, but by
ultimate and inevitable consequence,) to failure and degradation.</p>

<p>In those portions of his work which have a more immediate bearing upon
religious principles and conduct, the Author has not adopted the most
exciting mode of discussing the various subjects which have naturally
fallen under his review. Party spirit, though it seldom fails to
engender a more absorbing interest for the time, and often clothes a
subject with an importance not its own, will find in these pages no
response to its sentiments, under whatever character it may give
utterance to them. In these departments of his inquiry, to himself far
the most interesting, (and many such there are, especially in the
second volume,) the Author trusts that he has been guided by the
Apostolical maxim of "<span class="smcap">Speaking the Truth in Love</span>." He has not
willingly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagex" name="pagex">(p. x)</a></span>
advanced a single sentiment which should
unnecessarily cause pain to any individual or to any class of men; he
has not been tempted by morbid delicacy or fear to suppress or
disguise his view of the very <span class="smcap">Truth</span>.</p>

<p>The reader will readily perceive that, with reference to the foreign
and domestic policy of our country,&mdash;the advances of civilization,&mdash;the
manners of private life, as well in the higher as in the more
humble grades of society,&mdash;the state of literature,&mdash;the progress of
the English constitution,&mdash;the condition and discipline of the army,
which Henry greatly improved,&mdash;and the rise and progress of the royal
navy, of which he was virtually the founder, many topics are either
purposely avoided, or only incidentally and cursorily noticed. To one
point especially (a subject in itself most animating and uplifting,
and intimately interwoven with the period embraced by these Memoirs,)
he would have rejoiced to devote a far greater portion of his book,
had it been compatible with the immediate design of his
undertaking;&mdash;<span class="smcap">the promise and the dawn of the
Reformation</span>.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>However the value of his labours may be ultimately appreciated, the
Author confidently trusts that their publication can do no disservice
to the cause of truth, of sound morality, and of pure religion. He
would hope, indeed, that in one point at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexi" name="pagexi">(p. xi)</a></span>
least the power of
an example of pernicious tendency might be weakened by the issue of
his investigation. If the results of these inquiries be acquiesced in
as sound and just, no young man can be encouraged by Henry's example
(as it is feared many, especially in the higher classes, have been
encouraged,) in early habits of moral delinquency, with the intention
of extricating himself in time from the dominion of his passions, and
of becoming, like Henry, in after-life a pattern of religion and
virtue, "the mirror of every grace and excellence." The divine, the
moralist, and the historian know that authenticated instances of such
sudden moral revolutions in character are very rare,&mdash;exceptions to
the general rule; and among those exceptions we cannot be justified in
numbering Henry of Monmouth.</p>

<p>He was bold and merciful and kind, but he was no libertine, in his
youth; he was brave and generous and just, but he was no persecutor,
in his manhood. On the throne he upheld the royal authority with
mingled energy and mildness, and he approved himself to his subjects
as a wise and beneficent King; in his private individual capacity he
was a bountiful and considerate, though strict and firm master, a warm
and sincere friend, a faithful and loving husband. He passed through
life under the habitual sense of an overruling Providence; and, in his
premature death, he left us the example of a Christian's patient and
pious resignation to the Divine Will. As long
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexii" name="pagexii">(p. xii)</a></span>
as he lived,
he was an object of the most ardent and enthusiastic admiration,
confidence, and love; and, whilst the English monarchy shall remain
among the unforgotten things on earth, his memory will be honoured,
and his name will be enrolled among the <span class="smcap">Noble</span> and
the <span class="smcap">Good</span>.</p>

1387-1398.</h3>


<p>Henry the Fifth was the son of Henry of Bolinbroke and Mary daughter
of Humfrey Bohun, Earl of Hereford. No direct and positive evidence
has yet been discovered to fix with unerring accuracy the day or the
place of his birth. If however we assume the statement of the
chroniclers<a id="notetag002" name="notetag002"></a><a href="#note002">[2]</a>
to be true, that he was born at Monmouth on the ninth
day of August in the year
1387,<a id="notetag003" name="notetag003"></a><a href="#note003">[3]</a>
history supplies many ascertained
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page002" name="page002">(p. 002)</a></span>
facts not only consistent with that hypothesis, but in
confirmation of it; whilst none are found to throw upon it the
faintest shade of improbability. At first sight it might perhaps
appear strange that the exact time of the birth as well of Henry of
Monmouth, as of his father, two successive kings of England, should
even yet remain the subject of conjecture, tradition, and inference;
whilst the day and place of the birth of Henry VI. is matter of
historical record. A single reflection, however, on the circumstances
of their respective births, renders the absence of all precise
testimony in the one case natural; whilst it would have been
altogether unintelligible in the other. When Henry of Bolinbroke and
Henry of Monmouth were born, their fathers were subjects, and nothing
of national interest was at the time associated with their appearance
in the world; at Henry of Windsor's birth he was the acknowledged heir
to the throne both of England and of France.</p>

<p>To what extent Henry of Monmouth's future character and conduct were,
under Providence, affected by the circumstances of his family and its
several members, it would perhaps be less philosophical than
presumptuous to define. But, that those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page003" name="page003">(p. 003)</a></span>
circumstances were
peculiarly calculated to influence him in his principles and views and
actions, will be acknowledged by every one who becomes acquainted with
them, and who is at the same time in the least degree conversant with
the growth and workings of the human mind. It must, therefore, fall
within the province of the inquiry instituted in these pages, to take
a brief review of the domestic history of Henry's family through the
years of his childhood and early youth.</p>

<p>John, surnamed "of Gaunt," from Ghent or Gand in Flanders, the place
of his birth, was the fourth son of King Edward the Third. At a very
early age he married Blanche, daughter and heiress of Henry
Plantagenet, Duke of Lancaster, great-grandson of Henry the
Third.<a id="notetag004" name="notetag004"></a><a href="#note004">[4]</a>
The time of his marriage with
Blanche,<a id="notetag005" name="notetag005"></a><a href="#note005">[5]</a>
though recorded with
sufficient precision, is indeed comparatively of little consequence;
whilst the date of their son Henry's birth, from the influence which
the age of a father may have on the destinies of his child, becomes
matter of much importance to those who take any interest in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page004" name="page004">(p. 004)</a></span>
the history of their grandson, Henry of Monmouth. On this point it has
been already intimated that no conclusive evidence is directly upon
record. The principal facts, however, which enable us to draw an
inference of high probability, are associated with so pleasing and so
exemplary a custom, though now indeed fallen into great desuetude
among us, that to review them compensates for any disappointment which
might be felt from the want of absolute certainty in the issue of our
research. It was Henry of Bolinbroke's
custom<a id="notetag006" name="notetag006"></a><a href="#note006">[6]</a>
every year on the
Feast of the Lord's Supper, that is, on the Thursday before Easter, to
clothe as many poor persons as equalled the number of years which he
had completed on the preceding birthday; and by examining the accounts
still preserved in the archives of the Duchy of Lancaster, the details
of which would be altogether uninteresting in this place, we are led
to infer that Henry Bolinbroke was born on the 4th of April 1366.
Blanche, his mother, survived the birth of Bolinbroke probably not
more than three years. Whether this lady found in John of Gaunt a
faithful and loving husband, or whether his libertinism caused her to
pass her short life in disappointment and sorrow, no authentic
document enables us to pronounce. It is, however, impossible to close
our eyes against the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page005" name="page005">(p. 005)</a></span>
painful fact, that Catherine Swynford,
who was the partner of his guilt during the life of his second wife,
Constance, had been an inmate of his family, as the confidential
attendant on his wife Blanche, and the governess of her daughters,
Philippa and Elizabeth of Lancaster. That he afterwards, by a life of
abandoned profligacy, disgraced the religion which he professed, is,
unhappily, put beyond conjecture or vague rumour. Though we cannot
infer from any expenses about her funeral and her memory, that Blanche
was the sole object of his affections, (the most lavish costliness at
the tomb of the departed too often being only in proportion to the
unkindness shown to the living,) yet it may be worth observing, that
in 1372 we find an entry in the account, of 20<i>l.</i> paid to two
chaplains (together with the expenses of the altar) to say masses for
her soul. He was then
already<a id="notetag007" name="notetag007"></a><a href="#note007">[7]</a>
married to his second wife,
Constance, daughter of Peter the Cruel, King of Castile. By this lady,
whom he often calls "the Queen," he appears to have had only one
child, married, it is said, to Henry III. King of
Castile.<a id="notetag008" name="notetag008"></a><a href="#note008">[8]</a>
Constance, the mother, is represented to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006">(p. 006)</a></span>
have been one of the
most amiable and exemplary persons of the age, "above other women
innocent and devout;" and from her husband she deserved treatment far
different from what it was her unhappy lot to experience. But however
severe were her sufferings, she probably concealed them within her own
breast: and she neither left her husband nor abandoned her duties in
disgust. It is indeed possible, though in the highest degree
improbable, that whilst his unprincipled conduct was too notorious to
be concealed from others, she was not herself made fully acquainted
with his infidelity towards her. At all events we may indulge in the
belief that she proved to her husband's only legitimate son,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page007" name="page007">(p. 007)</a></span>
Henry of Bolinbroke, a kind and watchful mother.</p>

<p>At that period of our history, persons married at a much earlier age
than is usually the case among us now; and the espousals of young
people often preceded for some years the period of quitting their
parents' home, and living together, as man and wife. In the year 1381
Henry, at that time only fifteen years of age, was
espoused<a id="notetag009" name="notetag009"></a><a href="#note009">[9]</a>
to his
future wife, Mary Bohun,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page008" name="page008">(p. 008)</a></span>
daughter of the Earl of Hereford,
who had then not reached her twelfth year. These espousals were in
those days accompanied by the religious service of matrimony, and the
bride assumed the title of her espoused
husband.<a id="notetag010" name="notetag010"></a><a href="#note010">[10]</a></p>

<p>We shall probably not be in error, if we fix the period of the
Countess of Derby leaving her mother's for her husband's roof
somewhere in the year 1386, when he was twenty, and she sixteen years
old; and we are not without reason for believing that they made
Monmouth Castle their home.</p>

<p>Some modern writers affirm that this was the favourite residence of
John of Gaunt's family: but it is very questionable whether from
having themselves experienced the beauty and loveliness of the spot,
they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009">(p. 009)</a></span>
have not been unconsciously tempted to venture this
assertion without historical evidence. Monmouth is indeed situated in
one of the fairest and loveliest valleys within the four seas of
Britain. Near its centre, on a rising ground between the river Monnow
(from which the town derives its name) and the Wye and not far from
their confluence, the ruins of the Castle are still visible. The poet
Gray looked over it from the side of the Kymin Hill, when he described
the scene before him as "the delight of his eyes, and the very seat of
pleasure." With his testimony, unbiassed as it was by local
attachment, it would be unwise to mingle the feelings of affection
entertained by one whose earliest associations, "redolent of joy and
youth," can scarcely rescue his judgment from the suspicion of
partiality. At that time John of Gaunt's estates and princely mansions
studded, at various distances, the whole land of England from its
northern border to the southern coast. And whether he allowed Henry of
Bolinbroke to select for himself from the ample pages of his rent-roll
the spot to which he would take his bride, or whether he assigned it
of his own choice to his son as the fairest of his possessions; or
whether any other cause determined the place of Henry the Fifth's
birth, we have no reasonable ground for doubting that he was born in
the Castle of Monmouth, on the 9th of August 1387.</p>

<p>Of Monmouth Castle, the dwindling ruins are now very scanty, and in
point of architecture present nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010">(p. 010)</a></span>
worthy of an
antiquary's research. They are washed by the streams of the Monnow,
and are embosomed in gardens and orchards, clothing the knoll on which
they stand; the aspect of the southern walls, and the rocky character
of the soil admirably adapting them for the growth of the vine, and
the ripening of its fruits. In the memory of some old inhabitants, who
were not gathered to their fathers when the Author could first take an
interest in such things, and who often amused his childhood with tales
of former days, the remains of the Hall of Justice were still
traceable within the narrowed pile; and the crumbling bench on which
the Justices of the Circuit once sate, was often usurped by the boys
in their mock trials of judge and jury. Somewhat more than half a
century ago, a gentleman whose garden reached to one of the last
remaining towers, had reason to be thankful for a marked interposition
in his behalf of the protecting hand of Providence. He was enjoying
himself on a summer's evening in an alcove built under the shelter and
shade of the castle, when a gust of wind blew out the candle by his
side, just at the time when he felt disposed to replenish and rekindle
his pipe. He went consequently with the lantern in his hand towards
his house, intending to renew his evening's recreation; but he had
scarcely reached the door when the wall fell, burying his retreat, and
the entire slope, with its shrubs and flowers and fruits, under one
mass of ruin.</p>

<p>From
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page011" name="page011">(p. 011)</a></span>
this castle, tradition says, that being a sickly child,
Henry was taken to Courtfield, at the distance of six or seven miles
from Monmouth, to be nursed there. That tradition is doubtless very
ancient; and the cradle itself in which Henry is said to have been
rocked, was shown there till within these few years, when it was sold,
and taken from the house. It has since changed hands, if it be any
longer in existence. The local traditions, indeed, in the
neighbourhood of Courtfield and Goodrich are almost universally
mingled with the very natural mistake that, when Henry of Monmouth was
born, his father was king; and so far a shade of improbability may be
supposed to invest them all alike; yet the variety of them in that one
district, and the total absence of any stories relative to the same
event on every other side of Monmouth, should seem to countenance a
belief that some real foundation existed for the broad and general
features of these traditionary tales. Thus, though the account
acquiesced in by some writers, that the Marchioness of Salisbury was
Henry of Monmouth's nurse at Courtfield, may have originated in an
officious anxiety to supply an infant prince with a nurse suitable to
his royal birth; still, probably, that appendage would not have been
annexed to a story utterly without foundation, and consequently throws
no incredibility on the fact that the eldest son of the young Earl of
Derby was nursed at Courtfield. Thus, too, though the recorded
salutation of the ferryman
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page012" name="page012">(p. 012)</a></span>
of Goodrich congratulates his
Majesty on the birth of a noble prince, as the King was hastening from
his court and palace of Windsor to his castle of Monmouth; yet the
unstationary habits of Bolingbroke, his love of journeyings and
travels, and his restlessness at home, render it very probable that he
was absent from Monmouth even when the hour of perilous anxiety was
approaching; and thus on his return homeward (perhaps too from
Richard's court at Windsor) the first tidings of the safety of his
Countess and the birth of the young lord may have saluted him as he
crossed the Wye at Goodrich Ferry. So again in the little village of
Cruse, lying between the church and the castle of Goodrich, the
cottagers still tell, from father to son, as they have told for
centuries over their winter's hearth, how the herald, hurrying from
Monmouth to Goodrich fast as whip and spur could urge his steed
onward, with the tidings of the Prince of Wales' birth, fell headlong,
(the horse dropping under him in the short, steep, and rugged lane
leading to the ravine, beyond which the castle stands,) and was killed
on the spot. No doubt the idea of its being the news of a prince's
birth, that was thus posted on, has added, in the imagination of the
villagers, to the horse's fleetness and the breathless impetuosity of
the messenger; but it is very probable that the news of the young
lord's birth, heir to the dukedom of Lancaster, should have been
hastened from the castle of Monmouth to Goodrich; and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page013" name="page013">(p. 013)</a></span>
there
is no solid reason for discrediting the story.</p>

<p>Still, beyond tradition, there is no evidence at all to fix the young
lord either at Courtfield, or indeed at Monmouth, for any period
subsequently to his birth. On the contrary, several items of expense
in the "Wardrobe account of Henry, Earl of Derby," would induce us to
infer either that the tradition is unfounded, or that at the utmost
the infant lord was nursed at Courtfield only for a few months. In
that
account<a id="notetag011" name="notetag011"></a><a href="#note011">[11]</a>
we find an entry of a charge for a "<i>long gown</i>" for
the young lord Henry; and also the payment of 2<i>l.</i> to a midwife for
her attendance on the Countess during her confinement at the birth of
the young lord Thomas, the gift of the Earl, "<i>at London</i>." By this
document it is proved that Henry's younger brother, the future Duke of
Clarence, was born before October 1388, and that some time in the
preceding year Henry was himself still in the long robes of an infant;
and that the family had removed from Monmouth to London. In the
Wardrobe expenses of the Countess for the same year, we find several
items of sums defrayed for the clothes of the young lords Henry and
Thomas together, but no allusion whatever to the brothers being
separate: one
entry,<a id="notetag012" name="notetag012"></a><a href="#note012">[12]</a>
fixing Thomas and his nurse at Kenilworth
soon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page014" name="page014">(p. 014)</a></span>
after his birth, leaves no ground for supposing that
his elder brother was either at Monmouth or at Courtfield. It may be
matter of disappointment and of surprise that Henry's name does not
occur in connexion with the place of his birth in any single
contemporary document now known. The fact, however, is so. But whilst
the place of Henry's nursing is thus left in uncertainty, the name of
his nurse&mdash;in itself a matter not of the slightest importance&mdash;is made
known to us not only in the Wardrobe account of his mother, but also
by a gratifying circumstance, which bears direct testimony to his own
kind and grateful, and considerate and liberal mind. Her name was
Johanna Waring; on whom, very shortly after he ascended the throne, he
settled an annuity of 20<i>l.</i> "in consideration of good service done to
him in former
days."<a id="notetag013" name="notetag013"></a><a href="#note013">[13]</a></p>

<p>Very few incidents are recorded which can throw light upon Henry's
childhood, and for those few we are indebted chiefly to the dry
details of account-books. In these many particular items of expense
occur relative as well to Henry as to his brothers; which, probably,
would differ very little from those of other young noblemen of England
at that period of her history. The records of the Duchy of Lancaster
provide
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page015" name="page015">(p. 015)</a></span>
us with a very scanty supply of such particulars as
convey any interesting information on the circumstances and
occupations and amusements of Henry of Monmouth. From these records,
however, we learn that he was attacked by some complaint, probably
both sudden and dangerous, in the spring of 1395; for among the
receiver's accounts is found the charge of "6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for Thomas
Pye, and a horse hired at London, March 18th, to carry him to
Leicester with all speed, on account of the illness of the young lord
Henry." In the year 1397, when he was just ten years old, a few
entries occur, somewhat interesting, as intimations of his boyish
pursuits. Such are the charge of "8<i>d.</i> paid by the hands of Adam
Garston for harpstrings purchased for the harp of the young lord
Henry," and "12<i>d.</i> to Stephen Furbour for a new scabbard of a sword
for young lord Henry," and "1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for three-fourths of an ounce
of tissue of black silk bought at London of Margaret Stranson for a
sword of young lord Henry." Whilst we cannot but be sometimes amused
by the minuteness with which the expenditure of the smallest sum in so
large an establishment as John of Gaunt's is detailed, these little
incidents prepare us for the statement given of Henry's early youth by
the chroniclers,&mdash;that he was fond both of minstrelsy and of military
exercises.</p>

<p>The same dry pages, however, assure us that his more severe studies
were not neglected. In the accounts for the year ending February 1396,
we find
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page016" name="page016">(p. 016)</a></span>
a charge of "4<i>s.</i> for seven books of Grammar
contained in one volume, and bought at London for the young Lord
Henry." The receiver-general's record informs us of the name of the
lord Humfrey's
tutor;<a id="notetag014" name="notetag014"></a><a href="#note014">[14]</a>
but who was appointed to instruct the young
lord Henry does not appear; nor can we tell how soon he was put under
the guidance of Henry Beaufort. If, as we have reason to believe, he
had that celebrated man as his instructor, or at least the
superintendent of his studies, in Oxford so early as 1399, we may not,
perhaps, be mistaken in conjecturing, that even this volume of Grammar
was first learned under the direction of the future Cardinal.</p>

<p>Scanty as are the materials from which we must weave our opinion with
regard to the first years of Henry of Monmouth, they are sufficient to
suggest many reflections upon the advantages as well as the
unfavourable circumstances which attended him: We must first, however,
revert to a few more particulars relative to his family and its chief
members.</p>

<p>His father, who was then about twenty-four years of age, certainly
left
England<a id="notetag015" name="notetag015"></a><a href="#note015">[15]</a>
between the 6th of May
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page017" name="page017">(p. 017)</a></span>
1390 and the 30th of
April 1391, and proceeded to Barbary. During his absence his Countess
was delivered of Humfrey, his fourth son. Between the summers of 1392
and 1393 he undertook a journey to Prussia, and to the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p>The next year visited Henry with one of the most severe losses which
can befall a youth of his age. His
mother,<a id="notetag016" name="notetag016"></a><a href="#note016">[16]</a>
then only twenty-four
years old, having given birth to four sons and two daughters, was
taken away from the anxious cares and comforts of her earthly career,
in the very prime of
life.<a id="notetag017" name="notetag017"></a><a href="#note017">[17]</a>
Nor was this the only bereavement which
befell the family at this time. Constance, the second wife of John of
Gaunt, a lady to whose religious and moral worth the strongest and
warmest testimony is borne by the chroniclers of the time; and who
might (had it so pleased the Disposer of all things) have watched
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page018" name="page018">(p. 018)</a></span>
over the education of her husband's grandchildren, was also this
same year removed from them to her rest: they were both buried at
Leicester, then one of the chief residences of the family.</p>

<p>The mind cannot contemplate the case of either of these ladies without
feelings of pity rather than of envy. They were both nobly born, and
nobly married; and yet the elder was joined to a man, who, to say the
very least, shared his love for her with another; and the younger,
though requiring, every year of her married state, all the attention
and comfort and support of an affectionate husband, yet was more than
once left to experience a temporary widowhood. And if we withdraw our
thoughts from those of whom this family was then deprived, there is
little to lessen our estimate of their loss, when we think of those
whom they left behind. Henry's maternal grandmother, indeed, the
Countess of Hereford, survived her daughter many years; and we are not
without an intimation that she at least interested herself in her
grandson's welfare. In his will, dated 1415, he bequeaths to Thomas,
Bishop of Durham, "the missal and
portiphorium<a id="notetag018" name="notetag018"></a><a href="#note018">[18]</a>
which we had of the
gift of our dear grandmother, the Countess of
Hereford."<a id="notetag019" name="notetag019"></a><a href="#note019">[19]</a>
We may
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page019" name="page019">(p. 019)</a></span>
fairly infer from this circumstance that Henry had at least
one near relation both able and willing to guide him in the right way.
How far opportunities were afforded her of exercising her maternal
feelings towards him, cannot now be ascertained; and with the
exception of this noble lady, there is no other to whom we can turn
with entire satisfaction, when we contemplate the salutary effects
either of precept or example in the case of Henry of Monmouth.</p>

<p>His father indeed was a gallant young knight, often distinguishing
himself at justs and
tournaments;<a id="notetag020" name="notetag020"></a><a href="#note020">[20]</a>
of an active, ardent and
enterprising spirit; nor is any imputation against his moral character
found recorded. But we have no ground for believing, that he devoted
much of his time and thoughts to the education of his children.</p>

<p>Henry Beaufort, the natural son of John of Gaunt, a person of
commanding talent, and of considerable attainments for that age,
whilst there is no reason to believe him to have been that abandoned
worldling whose eyes finally closed in black despair
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page020" name="page020">(p. 020)</a></span>
without
a hope of Heaven, yet was not the individual to whose training a
Christian parent would willingly intrust the education of his child.
And in John of
Gaunt<a id="notetag021" name="notetag021"></a><a href="#note021">[21]</a>
himself, little perhaps can be discovered
either in principle, or judgment, or conduct, which his grandson could
imitate with religious and moral profit. Thus we find Henry of
Monmouth in his childhood labouring under many disadvantages. Still
our knowledge of the domestic arrangements and private circumstances
of his family is confessedly very limited; and it would be unwise to
conclude that there were no mitigating causes in operation, nor any
advantages to put as a counterpoise into the opposite scale. He may
have been under the guidance and tuition of a good Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page021" name="page021">(p. 021)</a></span>
and well-informed man; he may have been surrounded by companions whose
acquaintance would be a blessing. But this is all conjecture; and
probably the question is now beyond the reach of any satisfactory
solution.</p>

<p>With regard to the next step also in young Henry's progress towards
manhood, we equally depend upon tradition for the views which we may
be induced to take: still it is a tradition in which we shall probably
acquiesce without great danger of error. He is said to have been sent
to Oxford, and to have studied in "The Queen's College" under the
tuition of Henry Beaufort, his paternal uncle, then Chancellor of the
University. No document is known to exist among the archives of the
College or of the University, which can throw any light on this point;
except that the fact has been established of Henry Beaufort having
been admitted a member of Queen's College, and of his having been
chancellor of the university only for the year 1398.</p>

<p>This extraordinary man was consecrated Bishop of Lincoln, July 14,
1398, as appears by the Episcopal Register of that See; after which he
did not reside in Oxford. If therefore Henry of Monmouth studied under
him in that university, it must have been through the spring and
summer of that year, the eleventh of his age. And on this we may rely
as the most probable fact. Certainly in the old buildings of Queen's
College, a chamber used to be pointed out by successive generations as
Henry the Fifth's.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page022" name="page022">(p. 022)</a></span>
It stood over the gateway opposite to St.
Edmund's Hall. A portrait of him in painted glass, commemorative of
the circumstance, was seen in the window, with an inscription (as it
should seem of comparatively recent date) in Latin:</p>

<p class="figcenter smsize">
      To record the fact for ever.<br>
        The Emperor of Britain,<br>
     The Triumphant Lord of France,<br>
The Conqueror of his enemies and of himself,<br>
              Henry V.<br>
        Of this little chamber,<br>
      Once the great Inhabitant.<a id="notetag022"
name="notetag022"></a><a href="#note022">[22]</a><br>
</p>

<p>It may be observed that in the tender age of Henry involved in this
supposition, there is nothing in the least calculated to throw a shade
of improbability on this uniform tradition. Many in those days became
members of the university at the time of life when they would now be
sent to
school.<a id="notetag023" name="notetag023"></a><a href="#note023">[23]</a> And possibly we shall be most right in supposing
that Henry (though perhaps without himself being enrolled among the
regular academics) lived with his uncle, then chancellor, and studied
under his superintendence. There is nothing on record (hitherto
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page023" name="page023">(p. 023)</a></span>
discovered) in the slightest degree inconsistent with this view;
whereas if we were inclined to adopt the representation of some (on
what authority it does not appear) that Henry was sent to Oxford soon
after his father ascended the throne, many and serious difficulties
would present themselves. In the first place his uncle, who was
legitimated only the year before, was prematurely made Bishop of
Lincoln by the Pope, through the interest of John of Gaunt, in the
year 1398, and never resided in Oxford afterwards. How old he was at
his consecration, has not yet been satisfactorily established;
conjecture would lead us to regard him as a few years only (perhaps
ten or twelve) older than his nephew. Otterbourne tells us that he was
made
Bishop<a id="notetag024" name="notetag024"></a><a href="#note024">[24]</a>
when yet a boy.</p>

<p>In the next place we can scarcely discover six months in Henry's life
after his uncle's consecration, through which we can with equal
probability suppose him to have passed his time in Oxford. It is next
to certain that before the following October term, he had been removed
into King Richard's palace, carefully watched (as we shall see
hereafter); whilst in the spring of the following year, 1399, he was
unquestionably obliged to accompany that monarch in his expedition to
Ireland. Shortly after his return, in the autumn of that year, on his
father's accession to the throne, he was created Prince of Wales; and
through the following spring the probability is strong that his father
was too anxiously engaged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page024" name="page024">(p. 024)</a></span>
in negotiating a marriage between
him and a daughter of the French King, and too deeply interested in
providing for him an adequate establishment in the metropolis, to take
any measures for improving and cultivating his mind in the university.
Independently of which we may be fully assured that had he become a
student of the University of Oxford as Prince of Wales, it would not
have been left to chance, to deliver his name down to after-ages: the
archives of the University would have furnished direct and
contemporary evidence of so remarkable a fact; and the College would
have with pride enrolled him at the time among its members: as the boy
of the Earl of Derby, or the Duke of Hereford, living with his uncle,
there is
nothing<a id="notetag025" name="notetag025"></a><a href="#note025">[25]</a>
in the omission of his name inconsistent with our
hypothesis. At all events, whatever evidence exists of Henry having
resided under any circumstances in Oxford, fixes him there under the
tuition of the future Cardinal; and that well-known personage is
proved not to have resided there subsequently to his appointment to
the see<a id="notetag026" name="notetag026"></a><a href="#note026">[26]</a>
of Lincoln, in the summer of
1398.<a id="notetag027" name="notetag027"></a><a href="#note027">[27]</a></p>

<p>What
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page025" name="page025">(p. 025)</a></span>
were Henry's studies in Oxford, whether, like Ingulphus
some centuries before, he drank to his fill of
"Aristotle's<a id="notetag028" name="notetag028"></a><a href="#note028">[28]</a>
Philosophy and Cicero's Rhetoric," or whether his mind was chiefly
directed to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page026" name="page026">(p. 026)</a></span>
the scholastic theology so prevalent in his day,
it were fruitless to inquire. His uncle (as we have already intimated)
seems to have been a person of some learning, an excellent man of
business, and in the command of a ready eloquence. In establishing his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page027" name="page027">(p. 027)</a></span>
positions before the parliament, we find him not only quoting
from the Bible, (often, it must be acknowledged, without any strict
propriety of application,) but also citing facts from ancient Grecian
history. We may, however, safely conclude that the Chancellor of
Oxford confined himself to the general superintendence of his nephew's
education, intrusting the details to others more competent to instruct
him in the various branches of literature. It is very probable that to
some arrangement of that kind Henry was indebted for his acquaintance
with such excellent men as his friends John Carpenter of Oriel, and
Thomas Rodman, or Rodburn, of
Merton.<a id="notetag029" name="notetag029"></a><a href="#note029">[29]</a></p>

<p>But whatever course of study was chalked out for him,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page028" name="page028">(p. 028)</a></span>
and
through however long or short a period before the summer of 1398, or
under what guides soever he pursued it, it is impossible to read his
letters, and reflect on what is authentically recorded of him, without
being involuntarily impressed by an assurance that he had imbibed a
very considerable knowledge of Holy Scripture, even beyond the young
men of his day. His conduct also in after-life would prepare us for
the testimony borne to him by chroniclers, that "he held in great
veneration such as surpassed in learning and virtue." Still, whilst we
regret that history throws no fuller light on the early days of Henry
of Monmouth, we cannot but hope that in the hidden treasures of
manuscripts hereafter to be again brought into the light of day, much
may be yet ascertained on satisfactory evidence; and we must leave the
subject to those more favoured
times.<a id="notetag030" name="notetag030"></a><a href="#note030">[30]</a></p>

<p>But whilst doubts may still be thought to hang over the exact time and
the duration of Henry's academical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page029" name="page029">(p. 029)</a></span>
pursuits, it is matter of
historical certainty, that an event took place in the autumn of 1398,
which turned the whole stream of his life into an entirely new
channel, and led him by a very brief course to the inheritance of the
throne of England. His father, hitherto known as the Earl of Derby,
was created Duke of Hereford by King Richard II. Very shortly after
his creation, he stated openly in
parliament<a id="notetag031" name="notetag031"></a><a href="#note031">[31]</a>
that the Duke of
Norfolk, whilst they were riding together between Brentford and
London, had assured him of the King's intention to get rid of them
both, and also of the Duke of Lancaster with other noblemen, of whose
designs against his throne or person he was apprehensive. The Duke of
Norfolk denied the charge, and a trial of battle was appointed to
decide the merits of the question. The King, doubting probably the
effect on himself of the issue of that wager of battle, postponed the
day from time to time. At length he fixed finally upon the 16th of
September, and summoned the two noblemen to redeem their pledges at
Coventry. Very splendid preparations had been made for the struggle;
and the whole kingdom shewed the most anxious interest in the result.
On the day appointed, the Lord High Constable and the Lord High
Marshal of England, with a very great company, and splendidly arrayed,
first entered the lists. About the hour of prime the Duke of Hereford
appeared at the barriers on a white courser,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page030" name="page030">(p. 030)</a></span>
barbed with
blue and green velvet, sumptuously embroidered with swans and
antelopes<a id="notetag032" name="notetag032"></a><a href="#note032">[32]</a>
of goldsmith's
work,<a id="notetag033" name="notetag033"></a><a href="#note033">[33]</a>
and armed at all points. The
King himself soon after entered with great pomp, attended by the peers
of the realm, and above ten thousand men in arms to prevent any
tumult. The Duke of Norfolk then came on a steed "barbed with crimson
velvet embroidered with mulberry-trees and lions of silver." At the
proclamation of the herald, Hereford sprang upon his horse, and
advanced six or seven paces to meet his adversary. The king upon this
suddenly threw down his warder, and commanded the spears to be taken
from the combatants, and that they should resume their chairs of
state. He then ordered proclamation to be made that the Duke of
Hereford had
honourably<a id="notetag034" name="notetag034"></a><a href="#note034">[34]</a>
fulfilled his duty; and yet, without
assigning any reason, he immediately sentenced him to be banished for
ten years: at the same time he condemned the Duke of Norfolk to
perpetual exile, adding also the confiscation of his property, except
only one thousand pounds by the year. This act of tyranny towards
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page031" name="page031">(p. 031)</a></span>
Bolinbroke,<a id="notetag035" name="notetag035"></a><a href="#note035">[35]</a>
contrary, as the chroniclers say, to the known
laws and customs of the realm, as well as to the principles of common
justice, led by direct consequence to the subversion of Richard's
throne, and probably to his premature death.</p>

<p>Whilst however the people sympathized with the Duke of Hereford, and
reproached the King for his rashness, as impolitic as it was
iniquitous, they seemed to view in the sentence of the Duke of
Norfolk, the visitation of divine justice avenging on his head the
cruel murder of the Duke of Gloucester. It was remarked (says
Walsingham) that the sentence was passed on him by Richard on the very
same day of the year on which, only one twelvemonth before, he had
caused that unhappy prince to be suffocated in Calais.</p>

1398-1399.</h3>


<p>The first years of Henry of Monmouth fall, in part at least, as we
have seen, within the province of conjecture rather than of authentic
history: and the facts for reasonable conjecture to work upon are much
more scanty with regard to this royal child, than we find to be the
case with many persons far less renowned, and still further removed
from our day. But from the date of his father's banishment, very few
months in any one year elapse without supplying some clue, which
enables us to trace him step by step through the whole career of his
eventful life, to the very last day and hour of his mortal existence.</p>

<p>His father's exile dates from October 13, 1398, when Henry had just
concluded his eleventh year. Whether
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page033" name="page033">(p. 033)</a></span>
up to that time he had
been living chiefly in his father's house, or with his grandfather
John of Gaunt, or with his maternal grandmother, or with his uncle
Henry Beaufort either at Oxford or elsewhere, we have no positive
evidence. John of Gaunt did not die till the 3rd of the following
February, and he would, doubtless, have taken his grandson under his
especial care, at all events on his father's banishment, probably
assigning Henry Beaufort to be his tutor and governor. But when
Richard sentenced Henry of Bolinbroke, he was too sensible of his own
injustice, and too much alive, in this instance at least, to his own
danger, to suffer Henry of Monmouth to remain at large. One of the
most ancient, and most widely adopted principles of tyranny,
pronounces the man "to be a fool, who when he makes away with a
father, leaves the son in power to avenge his parent's wrongs."
Accordingly Richard took immediate possession of the persons both of
the son of the murdered Duke of Gloucester, and of Henry of Monmouth,
of whose relatives, as the chroniclers say, he had reason to be
especially afraid.</p>

<p>John of Gaunt, we may conclude, now disabled as he was, by those
infirmities<a id="notetag036" name="notetag036"></a><a href="#note036">[36]</a>
which hastened him to the
grave<a id="notetag037" name="notetag037"></a><a href="#note037">[37]</a>
more rapidly than
the mere progress of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page034" name="page034">(p. 034)</a></span>
calm decay, could exert no effectual
means either of sheltering his son from the unjust tyrant who
sentenced him to ten years banishment from his native land, or of
rescuing his grandson from the close custody of the same oppressor.
Still the very name of that renowned duke must have put some restraint
upon his royal nephew. The lion had yet life, and might put forth one
dying effort, if the oppression were carried past his endurance; and
it might have been thought well to let him linger and slumber on, till
nature should have struggled with him finally. We find, consequently,
that though before Bolinbroke's departure from England Richard had
remitted four years of his banishment, as a sort of peace-offering
perhaps to John of Gaunt, no sooner was that formidable person dead,
than Richard, throwing off all semblance of moderation, exiled
Bolinbroke for life, and seized and confiscated his
property.<a id="notetag038" name="notetag038"></a><a href="#note038">[38]</a></p>

<p>Though
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page035" name="page035">(p. 035)</a></span>
Richard behaved towards Bolinbroke with such reckless
injustice, he does not appear to have been forgetful of his wants
during his exile. Within two months of the date of his banishment the
Pell Rolls record payment (14 November 1398) "of a thousand marks to
the Duke of Hereford, of the King's gift, for the aid and support of
himself, and the supply of his wants, on his retirement from England
to parts beyond the seas assigned for his sojourn." And on the 20th of
the following June payment is recorded of "1586<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> part
of the 2000<i>l.</i> which the king had granted to him, to be advanced
annually at the usual times." But this was a poor compensation for the
honours and princely possessions of the Dukedom of Lancaster, and the
comforts of his home. No wonder if he were often found, as historians
tell, in deep depression of spirits, whilst he thought of "his four
brave boys, and two lovely daughters," now doubly orphans.</p>

<p>The plan of this work does not admit of any detailed enumeration of
the exactions, nor of any minute inquiry into the violence and
reckless tyranny of Richard. It cannot be doubted that a long series
of oppressive measures at this time alienated the affections of many
of his subjects, and exposed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page036" name="page036">(p. 036)</a></span>
his person and his throne to
the attacks of proud and powerful, as well as injured and insulted
enemies. His conduct appears to evince little short of infatuation. He
was determined to act the part of a tyrant with a high hand, and he
defied the consequences of his rashness. He had stopped his ears to
sounds which must have warned him of dangers setting thick around him
from every side; and he had wilfully closed his eyes, and refused to
look towards the precipice whither he was every day
hastening.<a id="notetag039" name="notetag039"></a><a href="#note039">[39]</a>
He
rushed on, despising the danger, till he fell once, and for ever. The
murder of the Duke of Gloucester, involving on the part of the king
one of the most base and cold-hearted pieces of treachery ever
recorded of any ruthless tyrant, had filled the whole realm with
indignation; and chroniclers do not hesitate to affirm that Richard
would have been then deposed and destroyed, had it not been for the
interposition of John of Gaunt; and now the eldest son of that very
man, who alone had sheltered him from his people's vengeance, Richard
banishes for ever without cause, confiscating his princely estates,
and pursuing him with bitter and insulting vengeance even in his
exile.</p>

<p>If <span class="pagenum"><a id="page037" name="page037">(p. 037)</a></span>
his own reason had not warned him beforehand against such
self-destroying acts of iniquity and violence, yet the signs of the
popular feeling which followed them, would have recalled any but an
infatuated man to a sense of the danger into which he was plunging.
When Henry of Bolinbroke left London for his exile, forty thousand
persons are said to have been in the streets lamenting his fate; and
the mayor, accompanied by a large body of the higher class of
citizens, attended him on his way as far as Dartford; and some never
left him till they saw him embark at
Dover.<a id="notetag040" name="notetag040"></a><a href="#note040">[40]</a>
But to all these clear
and strong indications of the tone and temper of his subjects, Richard
was obstinately blind and deaf. If he heard and saw them, he hardened
himself against the only practical influence which they were
calculated to produce. Setting the approaching political storm, and
every moral peril, at defiance, he quitted England just as though he
were leaving behind him contented and devoted subjects.</p>

<p>Having assigned Wallingford Castle for the residence of his Queen
Isabel, he departed for Ireland about the 18th of May; but did not set
sail from Milford Haven till the 29th; he reached Waterford on the
last day of the month. Though
Richard<a id="notetag041" name="notetag041"></a><a href="#note041">[41]</a>
was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page038" name="page038">(p. 038)</a></span>
prompted
solely by reasons of policy and by a regard to his own safety to take
with him to Ireland Henry of Monmouth, (together with Humphrey, son of
the murdered Duke of Gloucester,) we should do him great injustice
were we to suppose that he treated him as an
enemy.<a id="notetag042" name="notetag042"></a><a href="#note042">[42]</a>
On the
contrary, we have reason to believe that he behaved towards him with
great kindness and
respect.<a id="notetag043" name="notetag043"></a><a href="#note043">[43]</a></p>

<p>About midsummer the king advanced towards the country and strong-holds
of Macmore, his most formidable antagonist. On the opening of that
campaign he conferred upon young Henry the order of
knighthood;<a id="notetag044" name="notetag044"></a><a href="#note044">[44]</a>
and wishing to signalize this mark of the royal favour with unusual
celebrity, he conferred on that day the same distinction (expressly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page039" name="page039">(p. 039)</a></span>
in honour of Henry) upon ten others his companions in arms.
The particulars of this transaction, and the details of the entire
campaign against the Wild Irish, as they were called, are recorded in
a metrical history by a Frenchman named Creton, who was an eye-witness
of the whole affair. This gentleman had accepted the invitation of a
countryman of his own, a knight, to accompany him to England. On their
arrival in London they found the king himself in the very act of
starting for Ireland, and thither they went in his company as
amateurs.</p>

<p>This writer thus
describes<a id="notetag045" name="notetag045"></a><a href="#note045">[45]</a>
the courteous act and pledge of
friendship bestowed by Richard on his youthful companion and prisoner,
recording, with some interesting circumstances, the very words of
knightly and royal admonition with which the distinguished honour was
conferred. "Early on a summer's morning, the vigil of St. John, the
King marched directly to
Macmore<a id="notetag046" name="notetag046"></a><a href="#note046">[46],</a>
who would neither submit,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page040" name="page040">(p. 040)</a></span>
nor obey him in any way, but affirmed that he was himself the
rightful king of Ireland, and that he would never cease from war and
the defence of his country till death. Then the King prepared to go
into the depths of the deserts in search of him. For his abode is in
the woods, where he is accustomed to dwell at all seasons; and he had
with him, according to report, 3000 hardy men. Wilder people I never
saw; they did not appear to be much dismayed at the English. The whole
host were assembled at the entrance of the deep woods; and every one
put himself right well in his array: for it was thought for the time
that we should have battle; but I know that the Irish did not show
themselves on this occasion. Orders were then given by the King that
every thing around should be set fire to. Many a village and house
were then consumed. While this was going on, the King, who bears
leopards in his arms, caused a space to be cleared on all sides, and
pennon and standards to be quickly hoisted. Afterwards, out of true
and entire affection, he sent for the son of the Duke of Lancaster, a
<i>fair young and handsome
bachelor</i>,<a id="notetag047" name="notetag047"></a><a href="#note047">[47]</a>
and knighted him, saying, 'My
fair cousin, henceforth be gallant and bold, for, unless you conquer,
you will have little name for valour.' And for his greater honour and
satisfaction, to the end that it might be better imprinted on his
memory, he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page041" name="page041">(p. 041)</a></span>
made eight or ten other knights; but indeed I do
not know what their names were, for I took little heed about the
matter, seeing that melancholy, uneasiness and care had formed, and
altogether chosen my heart for their abode, and anxiety had
dispossessed me of joy."</p>

<p>The English suffered much from hunger and fatigue during this
expedition in search of the archrebel, and after many fruitless
attempts to reduce him, reached Dublin, where all their sufferings
were forgotten in the plenty and pleasures of that "good city."</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>The day on which Richard conferred upon Henry so distinguished a mark
of his regard and friendship, offering the first occasion on which any
reference is made to his personal appearance and bodily constitution,
the present may, perhaps, be deemed an appropriate place for recording
what we may have been able to glean in that department of biographical
memoir with which few, probably, are inclined to dispense.</p>

<p>M. Creton, in his account of this memorable knighthood, represents
Henry as "a handsome young bachelor," then in his twelfth year; and
very little further, of a specific character, is recorded by his
immediate contemporaries. The chroniclers next in succession describe
him as a man of "a spare make, tall, and well-proportioned,"
"exceeding," says Stow, "the ordinary stature
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page042" name="page042">(p. 042)</a></span>
of men;"
beautiful of visage, his bones small: nevertheless he was of
marvellous strength, pliant and passing swift of limb; and so trained
was he to feats of agility by discipline and exercise, that with one
or two of his lords he could, on foot, readily give chase to a deer
without hounds, bow, or sling, and catch the fleetest of the herd. By
the period of his early youth he must have outgrown the weakness and
sickliness of his childhood, or he could never have endured the
fatigues of body and mind to which he was exposed through his almost
incessant campaigns from his fourteenth to his twentieth year. These
hardships, nevertheless, may have been all the while sowing the seeds
of that fatal disease which at the last carried him so prematurely
from the labours, and vexations, and honours of this
world.<a id="notetag048" name="notetag048"></a><a href="#note048">[48]</a></p>

<p>With regard to his habits of social intercourse, his powers of
conversation, the disposition and bent of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page043" name="page043">(p. 043)</a></span>
his mind when he
mingled with others, whether in the seasons of public business, or the
more private hours of retirement and relaxation, (whilst the
never-ending tales of his dissipation among his unthrifty reckless
playmates are reserved for a separate inquiry,) a few words only will
suffice in this place. In addition to the testimony of later authors,
the records of contemporaneous antiquity, sometimes by direct allusion
to him, sometimes incidentally and as it were undesignedly, lead us to
infer that he was a distinguished example of affability and
courteousness; still not usually a man of many words; clear in his own
conception of the subject of conversation or debate, and ready in
conveying it to others, yet peculiarly modest and unassuming in
maintaining his opinion, listening with so natural an ease and
deference, and kindness to the sentiments and remarks and arguments of
others, as to draw into a close and warm personal attachment to
himself those who had the happiness to be on terms of familiarity with
him. Certainly the unanimous voice of Parliament ascribed to him, when
engaged in the deeper and graver discussions involving the interests
and welfare of the state, qualities corresponding in every particular
with these representations of individual chroniclers. The glowing,
living language of Shakspeare seems only to have recommended by
becoming and graceful ornament, what had its existence really and
substantially in truth.</p>

<p class="poem">

him but reason in divinity,<br>
And, all-admiring, with an inward wish<br>
You would desire the King were made a prelate:<br>

To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences.</p>


<p>Soon after Richard reached Dublin, the Duke of Albemarle, Constable of
England, arrived with a large fleet, and with forces all ready for a
campaign: but he came too late for any good purpose, and better had it
been for Richard had he never come at all. His advice was the king's
ruin. Richard with his army passed full six weeks in Dublin, in the
free enjoyment of ease and pleasure, altogether ignorant of the
terrible reverse which awaited him. In consequence of the
uninterrupted prevalence of adverse winds, his self-indulgence was
undisturbed by the news which the first change of weather was destined
to bring. Through the whole of this momentous crisis the weather was
so boisterous that no vessel dared to brave the tempest. On the return
of a quiet sea, a barge arrived at Dublin upon a Saturday, laden with
the appalling tidings that Henry, Duke of Lancaster, had returned from
exile
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page045" name="page045">(p. 045)</a></span>
and was carrying all before him; supported by
Richard's most powerful subjects, now in open rebellion against his
authority; and encouraged by the Archbishop, who in the Pope's name
preached plenary absolution and a place in paradise to all who would
assist the duke to recover his just rights from his unjust sovereign.
The King grew pale at this news, and instantly resolved to return to
England on the Monday following. But the Duke of Albemarle advised
that unhappy monarch, fatally for his interests, to remain in Ireland
till his whole navy could be gathered; and in the mean
time<a id="notetag049" name="notetag049"></a><a href="#note049">[49]</a>
to
send over the Earl of Salisbury. That nobleman departed forthwith,
(Richard solemnly promising to put to sea in six days,) and landed at
Conway, "the strongest and fairest town in Wales."</p>

<p>Either before the Earl of Salisbury's departure, or as is the more
probable, towards the last of those eighteen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page046" name="page046">(p. 046)</a></span>
days through
which afterwards, to the ruin of his cause, Richard wasted his time
(the only time left him) in Ireland, he sent for Henry of Monmouth,
and upbraided him with his father's treason. Otterbourne minutely
records the conversation which is said then to have passed between
them. "Henry, my child," said the King, "see what your father has done
to me. He has actually invaded my land as an enemy, and, as if in
regular warfare, has taken captive and put to death my liege subjects
without mercy and pity. Indeed, child, for you individually I am very
sorry, because for this unhappy proceeding of your father you must
perhaps be deprived of your inheritance." 'To whom Henry, though a
boy, replied in no boyish manner,' "In truth, my gracious king and
lord, I am sincerely grieved by these tidings; and, as I conceive, you
are fully assured of my innocence in this proceeding of my
father."&mdash;"I know," replied the King, "that the crime which your
father has perpetrated does not attach at all to you; and therefore I
hold you excused of it altogether."</p>

<p>Soon after this interview the unfortunate Richard set off from Dublin
to return to his kingdom, which was now passing rapidly into other
hands: but his two youthful captives, Henry of Monmouth, and Humfrey,
son of the late Duke of Gloucester, he caused to be shut up in the
safe keeping of the castle of
Trym.<a id="notetag050" name="notetag050"></a><a href="#note050">[50]</a>
From that day, which must have
been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page047" name="page047">(p. 047)</a></span>
somewhere about the 20th of August, till the following
October,<a id="notetag051" name="notetag051"></a><a href="#note051">[51]</a>
when he was created Prince of Wales in a full assembly of
the nobles and commons of England, we have no direct mention made of
Henry of Monmouth. That much of the intervening time was a season of
doubt and anxiety and distress to him, we have every reason to
believe. Though he had been previously detained as a hostage, yet he
had been treated with great kindness; and Richard, probably inspiring
him with feelings of confidence and attachment towards himself, had
led him to forget his father's enemy and oppressor in his own personal
benefactor and friend. Richard had now left him and his cousin (a
youth doubly related to him) as prisoners in a solitary castle far
from their friends, and in the custody of men at whose hands they
could not anticipate what treatment they might receive. How long they
remained in this state of close and, as they might well deem it,
perilous confinement, we do not learn. Probably the Duke of Lancaster,
on hearing of Richard's departure from Dublin, sent off immediately to
release the two captive youths; or at the latest, as soon as he had
the unhappy king within his power. On the one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048">(p. 048)</a></span>
hand it may be
argued that had Henry of Monmouth joined his father before the
cavalcade reached London, so remarkable a circumstance would have been
noticed by the French author, who accompanied them the whole way. On
the other hand we learn from the Pell Rolls that a ship was sent from
Chester to conduct him to London, though the payment of a debt does
not fix the date at which it was
incurred.<a id="notetag052" name="notetag052"></a><a href="#note052">[52]</a>
We may be assured no
time was lost by the Duke, by those whom he employed, or by his son;
at all events that Henry was restored to his father at Chester (a
circumstance which would be implied had Richard there been consigned
to the custody of young Humphrey), is not at all in evidence. The far
more reasonable inference from what is recorded is, that Humphrey, his
young fellow-prisoner and companion, and near relative and friend, was
snatched from him by sudden death at the very time when Providence
seemed to have opened to him a joyous return to liberty and to his
widowed mother. There is no reason to doubt that the news of Richard's
captivity, and the Duke of Lancaster's success, reached the two
friends whilst prisoners in Trym Castle; nor that they were both
released,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page049" name="page049">(p. 049)</a></span>
and embarked together for England. Where they were
when the hand of death separated them is not certainly known. The
general tradition is, that poor Humphrey had no sooner left the Irish
coast than he was seized by a fever, or by the plague, which carried
him off before the ship could reach England. But whether he landed or
not, whether he had joined the Duke or not before the fatal malady
attacked him, there is no doubt that his death followed hard upon his
release. His mother, the widowed duchess of his murdered father, who
had moreover never been allowed the solace of her child's company, now
bereft of husband and son, could bear up against her affliction no
longer. On hearing of her desolate state, excessive grief overwhelmed
her; and she fell sick and
died.<a id="notetag053" name="notetag053"></a><a href="#note053">[53]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to contemplate these two youthful relatives setting
out from the prison doors full of joy, and happy auguries, and mutual
congratulations, in health and spirits, panting for their dearest
friends,&mdash;one going to a princedom, and a throne, and a brilliant
career of victories, the other to disease and death,&mdash;without being
impressed with the wonderful acts of an inscrutable Providence, with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page050" name="page050">(p. 050)</a></span>
the ignorance and weakness of man, and with the resistless
will of the merciful Ruler of man's destinies. Even had young Humphrey
foreseen his dissolution, then so nigh at hand, as the gates of Trym
Castle opened for their release, he might well have addressed his
companion in words once used by the prince of Grecian philosophers at
the close of his defence before the court who condemned him. "And now
we are going, I indeed to death, you to life; to which of the two is
the better fate assigned is known only to
God!"<a id="notetag054" name="notetag054"></a><a href="#note054">[54]</a></p>

<p>Since this page was first written, the Author has been led to examine
the Pell
Rolls;<a id="notetag055" name="notetag055"></a><a href="#note055">[55]</a>
and he is induced to confess that, independently
of the full confirmation afforded by those original documents to
numberless facts referred to in these Memoirs, many an interesting
train of thought is suggested by the inspection of them. The bare and
dry entries of one single roll at the period now under consideration,
bring with them to his mind associations of a truly affecting,
serious, and solemn character. The very last roll of Richard II. by
the merest details of expenditure records the payment of sums made by
that unhappy monarch to Bolinbroke, then in exile, expatriated by his
unjust and wanton decree; to Humphrey, the orphan son
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page051" name="page051">(p. 051)</a></span>
of the
late murdered Duke of Gloucester; to Henry of Monmouth his cousin,
both then in Richard's safe keeping; and to Eleanor, the widowed
mother of Humphrey, and maternal aunt of Henry. Can any event paint in
deeper and stronger colouring the vicissitudes and reverses of
mortality, "the changes and chances" of our life on earth? Before the
scribe had filled the next half-year's roll, (now lying with it side
by side, and speaking like a monitor from the grave to high and low,
rich and poor, prince and peasant alike,)&mdash;of those five persons,
Richard had lost both his crown and his life; Bolinbroke had mounted
the throne from which Richard had fallen; Henry of Monmouth had been
created Prince of Wales, and was hailed as heir apparent to that
throne; his cousin Humphrey, once the companion of his imprisonment,
and the sharer of his anticipations of good or ill, had been carried
off from this world by death at the very time of his release; and the
broken-hearted Eleanor, (the root and the branch of her happiness now
gone for ever,) unable to bear up against her sorrows, had sunk under
their weight into her
grave!<a id="notetag056" name="notetag056"></a><a href="#note056">[56]</a></p>

<p>Whether Henry of Monmouth met his father and the cavalcade at Chester,
or joined them on their road to London, or followed them thither;
whether he witnessed on the way the humiliation and melancholy of his
friend, and the triumphant exaltation of his father, or not; every
step taken by either of those two chieftains through the eventful
weeks which intervened between King Richard making the youth a knight
in the wilds of Ireland, and King Henry creating him Prince of Wales
in the face of the nation at Westminster, bears immediately upon his
destinies. And the whole complicated tissue of circumstances then in
progress is so inseparably connected with him both individually and as
the future monarch of England, that a brief review of the proceedings
as well of the falling
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page053" name="page053">(p. 053)</a></span>
as of the rising antagonist seems
indispensable in this place.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Henry Bolinbroke (having now, by the death of John of
Gaunt,<a id="notetag057" name="notetag057"></a><a href="#note057">[57]</a>
succeeded to the dukedom of Lancaster,) found himself, during his
exile, far from being the only victim of Richard's rash despotism; nor
the only one determined to try, if necessary, and when occasion should
offer, by strength of hand to recover their lost country, together
with their property and their homes. Indeed, others proved
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page054" name="page054">(p. 054)</a></span>
to have been far more forward in that bold measure than himself.
Whilst he was in
Paris<a id="notetag058" name="notetag058"></a><a href="#note058">[58]</a>,
he received by the hands of Arundel,
Archbishop of Canterbury, an invitation to return, and set up his
standard in their native land.
Arundel,<a id="notetag059" name="notetag059"></a><a href="#note059">[59]</a>
himself one of Richard's
victims, had been banished two years before the Duke, by a sentence
which
confiscated<a id="notetag060" name="notetag060"></a><a href="#note060">[60]</a>
all his property. He made his way, we are told,
to Valenciennes in the disguise of a pilgrim, and, proceeding to
Paris, obtained an interview with Henry;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page055" name="page055">(p. 055)</a></span>
whom he found at
first less sanguine perhaps, and less ready for so desperate an
undertaking, than he expected. The Duke for some time remained,
apparently, absorbed in deep thought, as he leaned on a window
overlooking a garden; and at length replied that he would consult his
friends. Their advice, seconding the appeal of the Archbishop,
prevailed upon Henry to prepare for the hazardous enterprise; in which
success might indeed be rewarded with the crown of England, over and
above the recovery of his own vast possessions, but in which defeat
must lead inevitably to ruin. He left Paris for Brittany; and sailing
from one of its ports with three ships, having in his company only
fifteen lances or knights, he made for the English
coast.<a id="notetag061" name="notetag061"></a><a href="#note061">[61]</a>
About
the 4th of July he came to shore at the spot
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page056" name="page056">(p. 056)</a></span>
where of old
time had stood the decayed town of Ravenspur. Landing boldly though
with such a handful of men, he was soon joined by the Percies, and
other powerful leaders; and so eagerly did the people flock to him as
their deliverer from a headstrong reckless despot, that in a short
time he numbered as his followers sixty thousand men, who had staked
their property, their liberty, and their lives, on the same die. The
most probable account of his proceedings up to his return to Chester,
immediately before the unfortunate Richard fell into his hands, is the
following, for which we are chiefly indebted to the translator of the
"Metrical
History."<a id="notetag062" name="notetag062"></a><a href="#note062">[62]</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Lancaster's first measures, upon his landing, are not very
accurately recorded by historians, nor do the accounts impress us with
an opinion that they had arisen out of any digested plan of operation.
But a comparison of the desultory information which is furnished
relative to them, with what may fairly be supposed to be most
advisable on his part, will, perhaps, show that they were the result
of good calculation. The following is offered as the outline of the
scheme. To secure to Henry a chance of success, it was in the first
instance necessary, not only that the most powerful nobles remaining
at home should join him, but that means should be devised for
detaining the King in Ireland. It would be expedient to try the
disposition of the people on the eastern coast, and that he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page057" name="page057">(p. 057)</a></span>
should select a spot for his descent, from which he could immediately
put himself in communication with his friends: Yorkshire afforded the
greatest facility. The wind which took Albemarle over into Ireland
must have been advantageous to Lancaster; and the tempestuous weather
which succeeded must have been equally in his favour. He landed at
Ravenspur, and marched to Doncaster, where the Percies and others came
down to him. Knaresborough and Pontefract were his own by inheritance.
Having thus gained a footing, he marched toward the south; and his
opponents withdrew from before
him.<a id="notetag063" name="notetag063"></a><a href="#note063">[63]</a>
The council, consisting of the
Regent, Scroop, Bussy, Green, and Bagot, could interpose no obstacle,
and were driven by fear to Bristol. The Duke of York made some show of
resistance. Perhaps the others intended to make for Milford, and
thence to Ireland, or to await the King's arrival. Henry advanced to
Leicester and Kenilworth, both his own castles; and went through
Evesham to Gloucester and Berkeley. At Berkeley he came to an
agreement with the Duke of York, secured many of Richard's adherents,
passed on to Bristol, took the castle, slew three out of four of the
unfortunate ministers, and gained possession
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page058" name="page058">(p. 058)</a></span>
of a place
entirely disaffected to the King. From Bristol he directed his course
back to Gloucester, thence bearing westward to Ross and Hereford. Here
he was joined by the Bishop and Lord
Mortimer;<a id="notetag064" name="notetag064"></a><a href="#note064">[64]</a>
and, passing
through Leominster and Ludlow, he moved
onward,<a id="notetag065" name="notetag065"></a><a href="#note065">[65]</a>
increasing his
forces as he advanced towards Shrewsbury and Chester. In the mean time
the plans of Albemarle (if we acknowledge the reality of his alleged
treason) were equally successful. At all events Richard's course was
most favourable for Henry. Had he gone from Dublin to Chester, he
might have anticipated his enemy, and infused a spirit into his loyal
subjects. But he came southward whilst Henry was going northward; and,
about the time that Richard came on shore at Milford, Henry must have
been at Chester, surrounded by his friends, at the head of an immense
force, master of London, Bristol, and Chester, and of all the
fortresses that had been his own, or had belonged to Richard, within a
triangle, the apex of which is to be found in Bristol, the base
extending from the mouth of the Humber to that of the Dee.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>If in like manner we trace the steps of the misguided and infatuated
Richard, treacherous at once and betrayed, from the hour when the news
of Bolinbroke's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page059" name="page059">(p. 059)</a></span>
hostile and successful measures reached him
in Dublin to the day when he fell powerless into the hands of his
enemy, we shall find much to reprehend; much to pity; little, perhaps
nothing, which can excite the faintest shadow of respect. When the
Earl of Salisbury left Ireland, Richard solemnly promised him that he
would himself put to sea in six days; and the Earl, whose conduct is
marked by devoted zeal and fidelity in the cause of his unfortunate
master, acted upon that pledge. But whether misled by the treacherous
suggestions of Albemarle, or following his own self-will or imbecility
of judgment, Richard allowed eighteen days to pass away before he
embarked, every hour of which was pregnant with most momentous
consequences to himself and his throne. He landed at length at Milford
Haven, and then had with him thirty-two thousand men; but in one night
desertions reduced this body to six thousand. It is said that, on the
morrow after his return, looking from his window on the field where
his forces were encamped overnight, he was panic-struck by the
smallness of the number that remained. After deliberation, he resolved
on starting in the night for Conway, disguised in the garb of a poor
priest of the Friars-Minor, and taking with him only thirteen or
fourteen friends. He so planned his journey as to reach Conway at
break of day, where he found the Earl of Salisbury no less dejected
than himself. That faithful adherent had taken effectual
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page060" name="page060">(p. 060)</a></span>
means, on his first arrival in Wales, to collect an army of Cambrians
and Cheshiremen in sufficient strength, had the King joined them with
his forces, to offer a formidable resistance to Bolinbroke. But, at
the end of fourteen days, despairing of the King's arrival, they had
disbanded themselves, and were scattered over the country, or returned
to their own homes. On his clandestine departure also from Milford,
the wreck of his army, who till then had remained true, were entirely
dispersed: and his great treasure was plundered by the Welshmen, who
are said to have been indignant at the treachery of those who were
left in charge of it. Among many others, Sir Thomas Percy himself
escaped naked and wounded to the Duke of Lancaster.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>The page of history which records the proceedings of the two hostile
parties, from the day of Richard's reaching Conway to the hour of his
falling into the hands of Henry, presents in every line transactions
stained with so much of falsehood and baseness, such revolting
treachery and deceit, such wilful deliberate perjury, that we would
gladly pass it over unread, or throw upon it the most cursory glance
compatible with a bare knowledge of the facts. But whilst the
desperate wickedness of the human heart is made to stand out through
these transactions in most frightful colours, and whilst we shudder at
the wanton prostitution of the most solemn
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page061" name="page061">(p. 061)</a></span>
ordinances of the
Gospel, there so painfully exemplified, the same page suggests to us
topics of gratitude and of admonition,&mdash;gratitude that we live in an
age when these shameless violations of moral and religious bonds would
not be tolerated; and admonition that the principles of integrity and
righteousness can alone exalt a people, or be consistent with sound
policy. The truth of history here stamps the king, the nobleman, the
prelate, and the more humble instruments of the deeds then done, with
the indelible stain of dishonour and falsehood, and a reckless
violation of law human and divine.</p>

<p>The King, believing his case to be desperate, implored his friends to
advise him what course to adopt. At their suggestion he sent off the
Dukes of Exeter and Surrey to remonstrate with Bolinbroke, and to
ascertain his real designs. Meanwhile he retired with his little party
of adherents, not more than sixteen in all, first to Beaumaris; then
to Caernarvon, where he stayed four or five days, living on the most
scanty supply of the coarsest food, and having nothing better to lie
upon than a bed of straw. Though this was a very secure place for him
to await the issue of the present course of events, yet, unable to
endure such privations any longer, he returned to Conway. Henry,
meanwhile, having reduced Holt
Castle,<a id="notetag066" name="notetag066"></a><a href="#note066">[66]</a>
and possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page062" name="page062">(p. 062)</a></span>
himself of an immense treasure deposited there by Richard, was bent on
securing the person of that unhappy King. He consequently detained the
two Dukes in Chester Castle; and then, at the suggestion, it is said,
of Arundel, sent off the Earl of Northumberland with an injunction not
to return till either by truce or force he should bring back the King
with him. The Duke, attended by one thousand archers and four hundred
lances, advanced to Flint Castle, which forthwith surrendered to him.
From Flint he proceeded along a toilsome road over mountains and rocks
to Ruddlan, the gates of which were thrown open to him; when he
promised the aged castellan the enjoyment of his post there for life.
Richard knew nothing of these proceedings, and wondered at the absence
of his two noble messengers, who had started for Chester eight days
before. Northumberland, meanwhile, having left his men concealed in
ambush "under the rough and lofty cliffs of a rock," proceeded with
five or six only towards Conway. When he reached the
arm<a id="notetag067" name="notetag067"></a><a href="#note067">[67]</a>
of the
sea which washes the walls of that fortress, he sent over a herald,
who immediately obtained permission for his approach. Northumberland,
having reached the royal presence, proposed that the King should
proceed with Bolinbroke amicably to London, and there hold a
parliament, and suffer certain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page063" name="page063">(p. 063)</a></span>
individuals named to be put
on their trial. "I will swear," continued he, "on the body of our
Lord, consecrated by a priest's hand, that Duke Henry shall faithfully
observe all that I have said; for he solemnly pledged it to me on the
sacrament when we parted." Northumberland then withdrew from the royal
presence, when Richard thus immediately addressed his few counsellors:
"Fair sirs, we will grant it to him, for I see no other way. But I
swear to you that, whatever assurance I may give him, he shall be
surely put to a bitter death; and, doubt it not, no parliament shall
be held at Westminster. As soon as I have spoken with Henry, I will
summon the men of Wales, and make head against him; and, if he and his
friends be discomfited, they shall die: some of them I will flay
alive." Richard had declared, before he left Ireland, that if he could
but once get Henry into his power, he "would put him to death in such
a manner as that it should be spoken of long enough, even in Turkey."
Northumberland was then called in; and Richard assured him that, if he
would swear upon the Host, he would himself keep the agreement.
"Sire," said the Earl, "let the body of our Lord be consecrated. I
will swear that there is no deceit in this affair; and that the Duke
will observe the whole as you have heard me relate it here." Each of
them heard mass with all outward devotion, and the Earl took the oath.
Never was a contract made more solemnly, nor with a more fixed
purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page064" name="page064">(p. 064)</a></span>
on both sides not to abide by its engagements: it is
indeed a dark and painful page of history. Upon this pledge of faith,
mutually given, the King readily agreed to start, sending the Earl on
to prepare dinner at Ruddlan. No sooner had he reached the top of the
rock than he beheld the Earl and his men below; and, being now made
aware of the treachery by which he had fallen, he sank into despair,
and had recourse only to unmanly lamentations. His company did not
amount to more than five-and-twenty, and retreat was impossible. His
remonstrance with the Earl as he charged him with perjury and treason
availed nothing, and he was compelled to proceed. They dined at
Ruddlan, and in the afternoon advanced to Flint
Castle.<a id="notetag068" name="notetag068"></a><a href="#note068">[68]</a>
Northumberland lost no time in apprising the Duke of the success of
his enterprise. The messenger arrived at Chester by break of day; and
the Duke set off with his army, consisting, it is said, of not less
than one hundred thousand men. After mass, Richard beheld the Duke's
army approaching along the sea-shore. "It was marvellously great, and
showed such joy that the sound and noise of their instruments, horns,
buisines, and trumpets, were heard even as far as the castle." The
Duke sent forward the Archbishop, with two or three more, who
approached the King with profound reverence.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page065" name="page065">(p. 065)</a></span>
In this
interview, the first which the King had with Arundel since he banished
him the realm and confiscated his property, they conversed long
together, and alone. Whether any allusion was then made to the
necessity of the King abdicating the throne, must remain matter of
conjecture. The Archbishop (as the Earl of Salisbury reported) then
comforted the King in a very gentle manner, bidding him not to be
alarmed, for no harm should happen to his person.</p>

<p>The Duke did not enter the castle till Richard had dined, for he was
fasting. At the table he protracted the repast as long as possible,
dreading what would follow. Dinner ended, he came down to meet the
Duke, who, as soon as he perceived him, bowed very low. The King took
off his bonnet, and first addressed Bolinbroke. The French writer
pledges himself to the words, for, as he says, he heard them
distinctly, and understood them well. "Fair cousin of Lancaster, you
be right welcome." Then Duke Henry replied, bowing very low to the
ground, "My lord, I am come sooner than you sent for me; the reason
whereof I will tell you. The common report of your people is, that you
have for the space of twenty years and more governed them very badly
and very rigorously; and they are not well contented therewith: but,
if it please our Lord, I will help you to govern them better." King
Richard answered, "Fair cousin, since it pleaseth you, it pleaseth me
well."</p>

<p>Upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page066" name="page066">(p. 066)</a></span>
this Henry, when the time of departure was come, knowing
that Richard was particularly fond of fine horses, is said to have
called out with a stern and savage voice, "Bring out the King's
horses;" and then <i>they brought him two little horses not worth forty
francs</i>: the King mounted one, and the Earl of Salisbury the other. If
this statement of the French author be accurate, Henry compelled his
king to endure a studied mortification, as uncalled for as it was
galling. Starting from Flint about two o'clock, they proceeded to
Chester,<a id="notetag069" name="notetag069"></a><a href="#note069">[69]</a>
where the Duke was received with much reverence, whilst
the unhappy monarch was exposed to the insults of the populace. He was
immediately lodged in the castle with his few friends, and committed
to the safe
keeping<a id="notetag070" name="notetag070"></a><a href="#note070">[70]</a>
of his enemies. In Chester they remained three
days,<a id="notetag071" name="notetag071"></a><a href="#note071">[71]</a>
and then set out
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page067" name="page067">(p. 067)</a></span>
on the direct road for London.
Their route lay through Nantwich, Newcastle-under-Line, Stafford,
Lichfield, Daventry, Dunstable, and St. Alban's. Nothing worthy of
notice occurred during the journey, excepting that at Lichfield the
captive monarch endeavoured to escape at night, letting himself down
into a garden from the window of a tower in which they kept him. He
was however discovered, and from that time was watched most narrowly.</p>

<p>When they arrived within five or six miles of London, they were met by
various companies of the citizens, who carried Richard first to
Westminster, and next day to the Tower. Henry did not accompany him,
but turned aside to enter the city by the chief gate. Proceeding along
Cheapside to St. Paul's amidst the shouts of the people, he advanced
in full armour to the high altar; and, having offered his devotions
there, he turned to the tomb of his father and mother, at the sight of
which he was deeply affected. He lodged the first five or six days in
the Bishop's house; and, having passed another fortnight in the
hospital of St. John without Smithfield, he went to Hertford, where he
stayed three weeks. From that place he returned to meet the
parliament, which was to assemble in Westminster Hall on Wednesday the
first day of October.</p>

1399-1400.</h3>


<p>When the Parliament assembled in Westminster Hall on Wednesday,
October 1st, a deed of resignation of the crown, signed by the unhappy
Richard, and witnessed by various noblemen, was publicly read.
Whether, whilst a prisoner in the Tower, his own reflections on the
present desperate state of his affairs had persuaded him to sever
himself from the cares and dangers of a throne; whether he was
prevailed upon to take this view of his interests and his duty by the
honest and kind representations of his friends; or whether any degree
of violence by threat and intimidation, and alarming suggestions of
future evils had been applied, it would be fruitless to inquire. The
instrument indeed itself is couched in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page069" name="page069">(p. 069)</a></span>
terms expressive of
most voluntary and unqualified self-abasement, containing, among
others, such expressions as these: "I do entirely, of my own accord,
renounce and totally resign all kingly dignity and majesty; purely,
voluntarily, simply, and absolutely." On the other hand, if we believe
Hardyng,<a id="notetag072" name="notetag072"></a><a href="#note072">[72]</a>
the Earl of Northumberland asserted in his hearing, that
Richard was forced to resign under fear of death. Probably from his
first interview with the Archbishop in Flint Castle, to the hour
before he consented to execute the deed, his mind had been gradually
and incessantly worked upon by various agents, and different means,
short of actual violence, for the purpose of inducing him to make,
ostensibly at least, a voluntary resignation. He seems more than once
to have received both from Arundel and from Bolinbroke himself an
assurance of personal safety; and he is said to have expressed a hope
that "his cousin would be a kind lord to him."</p>

<p>The accounts which have reached us of the proceedings, from the hour
when Richard entered the Tower, to the day of his death, are by no
means uniform
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page070" name="page070">(p. 070)</a></span>
and consistent. The discrepancies however of
the various traditions neither involve any questions of great moment,
nor deeply affect the characters of those who were engaged in the
transactions. Of one point indeed we must make an exception, the cause
and circumstances of Richard's death; which, whether we look to Henry
of Monmouth's previous attachment to him, and the respect which he
industriously and cordially showed to the royal remains immediately
upon his becoming king himself; or whether we reflect on the vast
consequence, affecting Bolinbroke's character, involved in the
solution of that much-agitated question, may seem not only to justify,
but to call for, a distinct examination in these pages. The broad
facts, meanwhile, relative to the deposition of Richard and the
accession of Henry, are clear and indisputable; whilst some minor
details, which have excited discussions carried on in the spirit
rather of angry contention than of the simple love of truth, and which
do not bear immediately upon the objects of this work, may well be
omitted altogether.</p>

<p>After Richard had signed the deed of resignation, the steps were few
and easy which brought Henry of Bolinbroke to the throne. The
Parliament, either by acquiescence in his demand of the crown, or in
answer to the questions put by the Archbishop, elected Henry IV. to be
king, and denounced all as traitors who should gainsay his election
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page071" name="page071">(p. 071)</a></span>
or dispute his
right.<a id="notetag073" name="notetag073"></a><a href="#note073">[73]</a>
He was crowned on the Feast of St.
Edward, Monday, October 13, when his eldest son, Henry of Monmouth,
bore the principal sword of state; who, on the Wednesday following, by
assent of all the Estates of Parliament, was created Prince of Wales,
Duke of Cornwall, and Earl of Chester, and declared also to be heir to
the
throne.<a id="notetag074" name="notetag074"></a><a href="#note074">[74]</a>
On this occasion his father caused him to be brought
into his presence as he sate upon the throne; and placing a gold
coronet, adorned with pearls, on his head, and a ring on his finger,
and delivering into his hand a golden rod, kissed him and blessed him.
Upon which the Duke of York conducted him to the place assigned to him
in right of his principality. The Estates swore "the same faith,
loyalty, aid, assistance, and fealty" to the Prince, as they had sworn
to his father. Much interest seems to have been excited by this
creation of Henry of Monmouth as Prince of Wales. On the 3rd of
November the "Commons pray
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page072" name="page072">(p. 072)</a></span>
that they may be entered on the
record at the election of the Prince." Their petition can scarcely be
interpreted as betraying a jealousy of the
King's<a id="notetag075" name="notetag075"></a><a href="#note075">[75]</a>
right to create
a Prince of Wales independently of themselves; we must suppose it to
have originated in a desire to be recorded as parties to an act so
popular and national. At all events, in the then transition-state of
the royal authority, it was wise to combine the suffrages of all: and
the prayer of the Commons was granted. Another petition, presented on
the same day, acquaints us with the lively interest taken from the
very first by the nation at large in the safety and welfare of their
young Prince. They pray the King, "for-as-much as the Prince is of
tender age, that he may not pass forth from this realm: for we, the
Commons, are informed that the Scots are coming with a mighty hand;
and they of Ireland are purposed to elect a king among them, and
disdain to hold of you." This lively interest evinced thus early, and
in so remarkable a manner, by the Commons, in the safety and
well-being of Henry of Monmouth, seems never to have slackened at any
single period of his life, but to have grown still warmer and wider to
the very close of his career on earth. After the date of his creation
as Prince of Wales, history records but few facts relating to him,
either in his private
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page073" name="page073">(p. 073)</a></span>
or in his public capacity, till we
find him personally engaged in suppressing the Welsh rebellion; a
point of time, however, far less removed from the commencement of his
princedom than seems to have been generally assumed. In the same
month, (November 1399,) a negociation was set on foot, with the view
of bringing about a marriage between the Prince and one of the
daughters of the King of France. Since, however, he apparently took no
part whatever in the affair, the whole being a state-device to avoid
the restoration to France of Isabella's valuable paraphernalia; and
since the proposals of the treaty were for the marriage of a daughter
of France with the Prince, <span class="smcap">OR</span> <i>any other of the King's children</i>; we
need not dwell on a proceeding which reflects no great credit on his
father, or his father's
counsellors.<a id="notetag076" name="notetag076"></a><a href="#note076">[76]</a>
Not that the vague offers of
the negociation stamp the negociators with any especial disgrace. We
cannot read many pages of history without being apprised, sometimes by
painful instances, sometimes by circumstances rather ludicrous than
grave, that marriages were regarded as subjects of fair and honourable
negociation; but requiring no greater delicacy than nations would
observe in bargaining for a line of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page074" name="page074">(p. 074)</a></span>
territory, or individuals
in the purchase and sale of an estate. The negociation, however,
though the Bishop of Durham and the Earl of Worcester, both able
diplomatists, were employed on the part of England, was eventually
broken off; and Isabella was reluctantly and tardily restored to
France.</p>

<p>About the close of the present year, or the commencement of the
following (1400), the Prince makes a direct appeal to the
council,<a id="notetag077" name="notetag077"></a><a href="#note077">[77]</a>
that they would forthwith fulfil the expressed desire of his royal
father with reference to his princely state and condition in all
points. He requires them first of all to determine upon his place of
residence, and the sources of his income; and then to take especial
care that the King's officers, each in his own department and post of
duty, should fully and perfectly put into execution whatever orders
the council might give. "You are requested (says the memorial) to
consider how my lord the Prince is utterly destitute of every kind of
appointment relative to his household." The enumeration of his wants
specified in detail is somewhat curious: "that is to say, his
chapels,<a id="notetag078" name="notetag078"></a><a href="#note078">[78]</a>
chambers, halls, wardrobe, pantry,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page075" name="page075">(p. 075)</a></span>
buttery,
kitchen, scullery, saucery, almonry, anointry, and generally all
things requisite for his establishment."</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>It has been already intimated in the Preface, that an examination
would be instituted in the course of this work into the correspondence
of Shakspeare's representations of Henry's character and conduct with
the real facts of history, and we will not here anticipate that
inquiry. Only it may be necessary to observe, as we pass on, that the
period of his life when the poet first describes him to be revelling
in the deepest and foulest sinks of riot and profligacy, as nearly as
possible corresponds with the date of this petition to the council to
supply him with a home.</p>

<p>It was in the very first week of the year 1400 that Henry IV.
discovered the treasonable plot, laid by the Lords Salisbury,
Huntingdon, and others, to assassinate him during some solemn justs
intended to be held at Oxford, professedly in honour of his accession.
The King was then at Windsor; and, immediately on receiving
information of the conspiracy, he returned secretly, but with all
speed, to
London.<a id="notetag079" name="notetag079"></a><a href="#note079">[79]</a>
The defeat of these treasonable designs, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page076" name="page076">(p. 076)</a></span>
the execution of the conspirators, are matter of general
history; and, as the name of the Prince does not occur even
incidentally in any accounts of the transaction, we need not dwell
upon it. Probably he was then living with his father under the
superintendence of Henry Beaufort, now Bishop of Winchester, from whom
indeed up to this time he seems to have been much less separated than
from his parent. We have already seen that, whether for the benefit of
the "young bachelor," or, with an eye to his own security, unwilling
to leave so able an enemy behind, King Richard, when he took the boy
Henry with him to Ireland, caused his uncle and tutor (Henry Beaufort)
to accompany him
also.<a id="notetag080" name="notetag080"></a><a href="#note080">[80]</a>
The probability also has been shown to
approach demonstration that his residence in Oxford could not have
taken place at this time; but that it preceded his father's
banishment, rather than followed his accession to the throne. Be this
as it may, history (as far as it appears) makes no direct mention of
the young Prince Henry through the spring of 1400.</p>

<p>Soon, however, after the conspiracy against his father's life had been
detected and frustrated, an event took place, already alluded to,
which must have filled the warm and affectionate heart of Henry with
feelings of sorrow and distress,&mdash;the premature death of Richard. That
Henry had formed a sincere attachment for Richard, and long cherished
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page077" name="page077">(p. 077)</a></span>
his memory with gratitude for personal kindness, is
unquestionable; and doubtless it must have been a source of anxiety
and vexation to him that his father was accused in direct terms of
having procured the death of the deposed monarch. He probably was
convinced that the charge was an ungrounded calumny; yet, with his
generous indignation roused by the charge of so foul a crime, he must
have mingled feelings of increased regret at the miserable termination
of his friend's life.</p>

<p>The name of Henry of Monmouth has never been associated with Richard's
except under circumstances which reflect credit on his own character.
The bitterest enemies of his house, who scrupled not to charge Henry
IV. with the wilful murder of his prisoner, have never sought to
implicate his son in the same guilt in the most remote degree, or even
by the gentlest whisper of insinuation. Whether Richard died in
consequence of any foul act at the hand of an enemy, or by the fatal
workings of a harassed mind and broken heart, or by self-imposed
abstinence from food, (for to every one of these, as well as to other
causes, has his death been severally attributed,) is a question
probably now beyond the reach of successful inquiry. The whole subject
has been examined by many able and, doubtless, unprejudiced persons;
but their verdicts are far from being in accordance with each other.
The general (though, as it should now seem, the mistaken) opinion
appears to be, that after Richard
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page078" name="page078">(p. 078)</a></span>
had been removed from the
Tower to Leeds Castle, and thence to other places of safe custody, and
had finally been lodged in
Pontefract,<a id="notetag081" name="notetag081"></a><a href="#note081">[81]</a>
the partisans of Henry IV.
hastened his death. The Archbishop of York directly charged the King
with the foul crime of murder, which he as positively and indignantly
denied.<a id="notetag082" name="notetag082"></a><a href="#note082">[82]</a>
The minutes of the Privy Council have not been
sufficiently noticed by former writers on this event; and the
reflections of the
Editor,<a id="notetag083" name="notetag083"></a><a href="#note083">[83]</a>
in his Preface, are so sensible and so
immediately to the point, that we may be contented in these pages to
do little more than record his
sentiments.<a id="notetag084" name="notetag084"></a><a href="#note084">[84]</a></p>

<p>"Shortly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page079" name="page079">(p. 079)</a></span>
after the attempt of the Earls of Kent, Salisbury,
and Huntingdon to restore Richard to the throne, a great council was
held for the consideration of many important matters. The first point
was 'that if Richard the late king be alive, as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page080" name="page080">(p. 080)</a></span>
some suppose
he is, it be ordained that he be well and securely guarded for the
salvation of the state of the King and of his kingdom.' On which
subject the council resolved, that it was necessary to speak to the
King, that, in case Richard the late king be still living, he be
placed in security agreeably to the law of the realm; but if he be
dead, then that he be openly showed to the people, that they may have
knowledge thereof." These minutes (observes Sir Harris Nicolas) appear
to exonerate
Henry<a id="notetag085" name="notetag085"></a><a href="#note085">[85]</a>
from the generally received charge of having
sent Sir Piers Exton to Pontefract for the purpose of murdering his
prisoner. Had such been the fact, it is impossible to believe that one
of Henry's ministers would have gone through the farce of submitting
the above question to the council; or that the council would, with
still greater absurdity, have deliberated on the subject, and gravely
expressed the opinion which they offered to the King. A corpse, which
was said to be that of Richard, was publicly exhibited at St. Paul's
by Henry's direction, and he has been accused of substituting the body
of some other person; but these minutes prove that the idea of such an
exposure came from the council, and, at the moment when it was
suggested, they actually did not know whether Richard was dead or
alive, because they provided for either contingency. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page081" name="page081">(p. 081)</a></span>
is
also demonstrated by them that, so far from any violence or
ill-treatment being meditated in case he were living, the council
merely recommended that he should be placed in such security as might
be approved by the peers of the
realm.<a id="notetag086" name="notetag086"></a><a href="#note086">[86]</a>
It must be observed that
this new piece of evidence, coupled with the fact that a corpse said
to be the body of Richard was exhibited shortly after the meeting of
the council, strongly supports the belief that he died about the 14th
of February 1400, and that Henry and his council were innocent of
having by unfair means produced or accelerated his decease."</p>

<p>Such we may hope to have been the case: at all events, the purpose of
this work does not admit of any fuller investigation of the points at
issue. If Henry were accessory to Richard's death, (to use an
expression quoted as that unhappy king's own
words,)<a id="notetag087" name="notetag087"></a><a href="#note087">[87]</a>
"it would be
a reproach to him for ever, so long as the world shall endure, or the
deep ocean be able to cast up tide or wave." It is, however,
satisfactory to find in these authentic documents evidence which seems
to justify us in adopting no other alternative than to return for
Bolinbroke a verdict of "Not guilty." The
corpse<a id="notetag088" name="notetag088"></a><a href="#note088">[88]</a>
of Richard was
carried through the city of London to St. Paul's with much of
religious ceremony and solemn pomp, Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page082" name="page082">(p. 082)</a></span>
himself as King
bearing the pall, "followed by all those of his blood in fair array."
After it had been inspected by multitudes,
(Froissart<a id="notetag089" name="notetag089"></a><a href="#note089">[89]</a>
says by more
than twenty thousand,) it was buried at Langley, where Richard had
built a Dominican convent. Henry V, soon after his accession, removed
the corpse to Westminster Abbey, and, laid it by the side of Ann,
Richard's former queen, in the tomb which he had prepared for her and
himself.<a id="notetag090" name="notetag090"></a><a href="#note090">[90]</a></p>

<p>Henry IV. had no sooner gained the throne of England, than he was made
to feel that he could retain possession of it only by unremitting
watchfulness, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083">(p. 083)</a></span>
by a vigorous overthrow of each successive
design of his enemies as it arose. In addition as well to the
hostility of France (whose monarch and people were grievously incensed
by the deposition of Richard), as to the restless warfare of the
Scots, he was compelled to provide against the more secret and more
dangerous machinations of his own
subjects.<a id="notetag091" name="notetag091"></a><a href="#note091">[91]</a>
After the discovery
and defeat of the plot laid by the malcontent lords in the beginning
of January (1400), he first employed himself in making preparations to
repress the threatened
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page084" name="page084">(p. 084)</a></span>
aggressions of his northern
neighbours. His council had received news as early as the 9th of
February of the intention of the Scots to invade England; indeed, as
far back as the preceding November, the petition of the Commons
informs us that they considered war with Scotland inevitable. On this
campaign Henry IV. resolved to enter in his own person, and he left
London for the North in the June following. Our later historians seem
not to have entertained any doubts as to the accuracy of some early
chroniclers, when they state that Henry of Monmouth was sent on
towards Scotland as his father's representative, in command of the
advanced guard, in the opening of the
summer<a id="notetag092" name="notetag092"></a><a href="#note092">[92]</a>
of 1400. Elmham
states the general fact that Henry was sent on with the first troops,
but in the manuscript there is a "Quære" in the margin in the same
hand-writing. And the querist seems to have had sufficient reasons for
expressing his doubts as to the accuracy of such a statement. The
renown of the Prince as a youthful warrior will easily account for any
premature date assigned to his earliest campaign; whilst the age of
his father, who was seen at the head of the invading army in Scotland,
might perhaps have contributed to a mistake. The King himself, at that
time personally little known among his subjects, was not more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page085" name="page085">(p. 085)</a></span>
than thirty-four years
old.<a id="notetag093" name="notetag093"></a><a href="#note093">[93]</a>
Be this as it may, we have great
reason to believe that Henry IV, when he proceeded northward, left the
Prince of Wales at home. In the first place, we must remember that,
among their primary and most solemn acts after the King's coronation,
the Commons, anticipating the certainty of this expedition into
Scotland, preferred to him a petition, praying that the Prince by
reason of his tender age might not go thither, "nor elsewhere forth of
the realm." The letter too of Lord Grey of Ruthyn, to which we must
hereafter refer, announcing the turbulent state of Wales, and the
necessity of suppressing its disorders with a stronger hand, can best
be explained on the supposition that the King was absent at the date
of that
letter,<a id="notetag094" name="notetag094"></a><a href="#note094">[94]</a>
about Midsummer 1400, and that the Prince was at
home. Lord Grey addresses his letter to the Prince, and not to the
King; though the King, as well as the Prince, had commissioned him to
put down the rising disturbances in his
neighbourhood.<a id="notetag095" name="notetag095"></a><a href="#note095">[95]</a>
Some,
perhaps, may think this intelligible on the ground that Lord Grey
wrote to Henry as Prince of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086">(p. 086)</a></span>
Wales, and therefore more
immediately intrusted with the preservation of its peace. But his
suggestion to the Prince to take the advice of the King's
council,&mdash;"with advice of our liege lord his council,"&mdash;is scarcely
consistent with the idea of the King himself being at hand to give the
necessary directions and a "more plainer commission."</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Be this however as it may: whether Henry of Monmouth's noviciate in
arms was passed on the Scotch borders, (for in Ireland, as the
companion of Richard, he had been merely a spectator,) or whether, as
the evidence seems to preponderate, we consider the chroniclers to
have antedated his first campaign, he was not allowed to remain long
without being personally engaged in a struggle of far greater
magnitude in itself, and of vastly more importance to the whole realm
of England, than any one could possibly infer from the brief and
cursory references made to it by the historians who are the most
generally consulted by our countrymen. The rebellion of Owyn
Glyndowr<a id="notetag096" name="notetag096"></a><a href="#note096">[96]</a>
is despatched by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page087" name="page087">(p. 087)</a></span>
Hume in less than two octavo
pages, though it once certainly struck a panic into the very heart of
England, and through the whole of Henry IV.'s reign, more or less,
involved a considerable portion of the kingdom in great alarm;
carrying devastation far and wide through some of its fairest
provinces; and at one period of the struggle, by the succour of
Henry's foreign and domestic enemies, with whom the Welsh made common
cause, threatening to wrest the sceptre itself from the hands of that
monarch. The part which his son Henry of Monmouth was destined to take
personally in resisting the progress of this rebellion, and the
evidence which the indisputable facts recorded of that protracted
contest bear to his character, (facts, most of which are comparatively
little known, and many of which are altogether new in history,) seem
to require at our hands a somewhat fuller investigation into the
origin, progress, and circumstances of this rebellion, than has
hitherto been undertaken by our chroniclers.</p>

1400-1401.</h3>


<p>Previously to the accession of Henry IV, Wales had enjoyed, for nearly
seventy years, a season of comparative security and rest. During the
desperate struggles in the reign of Henry III, in which its
inhabitants, chiefly under their Prince Llewellin, fought so
resolutely for their freedom, many districts of the Principality,
especially the border-lands, had been rendered all but deserts. From
this melancholy devastation they had scarcely recovered, when Queen
Isabella, wife of Edward II, headed the rebel army against her own
husband, who had taken refuge in Glamorganshire; and carried with her
the most dreadful of all national scourges,&mdash;a sanguinary civil war.
The whole country of South Wales, we are told, was so miserably
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page089" name="page089">(p. 089)</a></span>
ravaged by these intestine horrors, and the dearth consequent
upon them was so excessive, that horses and dogs became at last the
ordinary food of the miserable survivors. From the accession of Edward
III, and throughout his long reign, Wales seems to have enjoyed
undisturbed tranquillity and repose. Its oppressors were improving
their fortunes, rapidly and largely, in France, reaping a far more
abundant harvest in her rich domains than this impoverished land could
have offered to their expectations. Through the whole reign also of
Richard II, we hear of no serious calamity having befallen these
ancient possessors of Britain. A friendly intercourse seems at that
time to have been formed between the Principality and the kingdom at
large; and a devoted attachment to the person of the King appears to
have sprung up generally among the Welsh, and to have grown into
maturity. We may thus consider the natives of Wales to have enjoyed a
longer period of rest and peace than had fallen to their lot for
centuries before, when the deposition of Richard, who had taken refuge
among their strongholds, and in defence of whom they would have risked
their property and their lives, prepared them to follow any chieftain
who would head his countrymen against the present dynasty, and direct
them in their struggle to throw off the English, or rather, perhaps,
the Lancastrian yoke.</p>

<p>The French writer to whom we have so often referred,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page090" name="page090">(p. 090)</a></span>
M.
Creton, in describing the creation of Henry of Monmouth as Prince of
Wales, employs these remarkable words: "Then arose Duke Henry. His
eldest son, who humbly knelt before him, he made Prince of Wales, and
gave him the land; but I think he must conquer it if he will have it:
for in my opinion the Welsh would on no account allow him to be their
lord, for the sorrow, evil, and disgrace which the English, together
with his father, had brought upon King Richard." How correctly this
foreigner had formed an estimate of the feelings and principles of the
Welsh, will best appear from that portion of Henry's life on which we
are now entering. His prediction was fully verified by the event.
Henry of Monmouth was compelled to conquer Wales for himself; and in a
struggle, too, which lasted through an entire third part of his
eventful career.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>In accounting for the origin of the civil war in Wales, historians
generally dwell on the injustice and insults committed by Lord Grey of
Ruthyn on Owyn Glyndowr, and the consequent determination of that
resolute chief to take vengeance for the wrongs by which he had been
goaded. Probably the far more correct view is to consider the Welsh at
large as altogether ready for revolt, and the conduct of Lord Grey as
having only instigated Owyn to put himself at their head; at all
events to accept the office of leader, to which, as we are told, his
countrymen<a id="notetag097" name="notetag097"></a><a href="#note097">[97]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page091" name="page091">(p. 091)</a></span>
elected him. The train was already laid in
the unshaken fidelity of the Welsh to their deposed monarch, whom they
believed to be still
alive<a id="notetag098" name="notetag098"></a><a href="#note098">[98]</a>
and in the deadly hatred against all
who had assisted Henry of Lancaster in his act of usurpation; the
spark was supplied by the resentment of a personal injury. His
countrymen were ripe for rebellion, and Owyn was equally ready to
direct their counsels, and to head them in the field of battle.</p>

<p>Owyn
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page092" name="page092">(p. 092)</a></span>
Glyndowr was no upstart adventurer. He was of an ancient
family, or rather, we must say, of princely extraction, being
descended from Llewellin ap Jorwarth Droyndon, Prince of Wales. We
have reason to conclude that he succeeded to large hereditary
property. The exact time of his birth is not known: most writers have
placed it between 1349 and 1354; but it was probably later by five
years than the latter of those two
dates.<a id="notetag099" name="notetag099"></a><a href="#note099">[99]</a>
This extraordinary man,
whose unwearied zeal and indomitable bravery, had they taken a
different direction, would have merited, humanly speaking, a better
fate, was invested by the superstitions of the times with a
supernatural character. His vaunt to Hotspur is not so much the
offspring of Shakspeare's imagination, as an echo to the popular
opinions generally entertained of
him:<a id="notetag100" name="notetag100"></a><a href="#note100">[100]</a></p>


<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page093" name="page093">(p. 093)</a></span>
<span class="left20">At my birth</span><br>

The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds<br>

I am not in the roll of common men.<br>
<span class="left30 smsize">1</span> <span class="smcap">Henry</span> IV. iii. 1.</p>


<p>Whether Owyn had persuaded himself to believe the fabulous stories
told of his birth; or whether for purposes of policy he merely
countenanced, in the midst of an ignorant and superstitious people,
what others had invented and spread; there is no doubt that even in
his lifetime he was supposed, not only within the borders of his
father-land, but even through England itself, to have intercourse with
the spirits of the invisible world, and through their agency to
possess, among other vague and indefinite powers, a supernatural
influence over the elements, and to have the winds and storms at his
bidding. Absurd as were the fables told concerning him, they exercised
great influence on his enemies as well as his friends; and few,
perhaps, dreaded the powers of his spell more than the King himself.
Still, independently of any aid from superstition, Glyndowr combined
in his own person many qualities fitting him for the prominent station
which he acquired, and which he so long maintained among his
countrymen; and as the enemy of Henry IV. he was one of a very
numerous and powerful body, formed from among the first persons of the
whole realm.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page094" name="page094">(p. 094)</a></span>
He received his education in London, and
studied in one of the Inns of Court. He became afterwards an esquire
of the body to King Richard; and he was one of the few faithful
subjects who remained in his suite till he was taken prisoner in Flint
Castle. After his master's fall he was for a short time esquire to the
Earl of Arundel, whose castle, situated in the immediate neighbourhood
of Glyndowrdy, was called Castel Dinas Bran. Its ruins, with the hill
on the crown of which it was built, still form a most striking object
near Llangollen, on the right of the magnificent road leading from
Shrewsbury to Bangor.</p>

<p>A few months only had elapsed after the deposition of Richard when
those occurrences took place which are said to have driven Glyndowr
into open revolt. He was residing on his estate, which lay contiguous
to the lands of Lord Grey of Ruthyn. That nobleman claimed and seized
some part of Owyn's property. Against this act of oppression Owyn
petitioned the Parliament, which sate early in 1400, praying for
redress. The Bishop of St. Asaph is said to have cautioned the
Parliament not to treat the Welshman with neglect, lest his countrymen
should espouse his cause and have recourse to arms. This advice was
disregarded, and Owyn's petition was dismissed in the most uncourteous
manner.<a id="notetag101" name="notetag101"></a><a href="#note101">[101]</a></p>

<p>Another
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page095" name="page095">(p. 095)</a></span>
act of injustice and treachery on the part of Lord
Grey drove Owyn to take the desperate step either of raising the
standard of rebellion, or of joining his countrymen who had already
raised it. Lord Grey withheld the letter of summons for the Welsh
chief to attend the King in his expedition against Scotland, till it
was too late for him to join the rendezvous. Owyn excused himself on
the shortness of the notice; but Lord Grey reported him as
disobedient. Aware that he had incurred the King's displeasure, and
could expect no mercy, since his deadly foe had possession of the
royal ear, Owyn put himself boldly at the head of his rebellious
countrymen, who almost unanimously renounced their allegiance to the
crown of England, and subsequently acknowledged Owyn as their
sovereign lord.</p>

<p>The Monk of Evesham, and the MS. Chronicle which used to be regarded
as the compilation of one of Henry V.'s chaplains, both preserved in
the British Museum, speak of the Welsh as having first risen in arms,
and as having afterwards elected Owyn for their chief. It is, however,
remarkable that no mention is made of Owyn Glyndowr in the King's
proclamations, or any public document till the spring of 1401.
Probably at first the proceedings, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page096" name="page096">(p. 096)</a></span>
which he took
afterwards so pre-eminent a part, resembled riotous outrages, breaking
forth in entire defiance of the law, but conducted neither on any
preconcerted plan, nor under the direction of any one leader.</p>

<p>Lord Grey's ancestors had received Ruthyn with a view to the
protection of the frontier; and on the first indication of the
rebellious spirit breaking out in acts of disorder and violence, both
the King and the Prince wrote separately to Lord Grey, reminding him
of his duty to disperse the rioters, and put down the insurgents.
These mandates were despatched probably in the beginning of June 1400,
some days before the King departed for the borders of Scotland. Lord
Grey, in the
letter<a id="notetag102" name="notetag102"></a><a href="#note102">[102]</a>
to which we have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page097" name="page097">(p. 097)</a></span>
above referred,
supposing that the King had already started on that expedition,
returned an answer only to the Prince, acknowledging the receipt of
his and his father's commands; but pleading the impossibility of
executing them with effect, unless the Prince, with the advice of the
King's council, would forward to him a commission with more ample
powers, authorizing him to lay hands on the insurgents in whatever
part of the country they might chance to be found; ordaining also that
no lord's land should be respected as a sanctuary to shield them from
the law; and that all the King's officers should be enjoined through
the whole territory to aid and assist in quelling the
insurrection.<a id="notetag103" name="notetag103"></a><a href="#note103">[103]</a></p>

<p>This nobleman had evidently taken a very alarming view of the state of
the country; and the first documents
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page098" name="page098">(p. 098)</a></span>
which we inspect
manifest the uncurbed fury and deadly hatred with which the Welsh
rushed into this rebellion. Indeed, the general character of Owyn's
campaigns breathes more "of savage warfare than of chivalry." Lord
Grey's letter is dated June 23, and must have been written in the year
1400; for, long before the corresponding month in the following year
had come round, the Prince had himself been personally engaged in the
district which the Earl was more especially appointed to guard.</p>

<p>It does not appear what steps were taken in consequence of this
communication of Lord Grey; except that the King, on the 19th of
September, issued his first proclamation against the rebels. Probably
on his return from Scotland, the King went himself immediately towards
Wales; for the Monk of Evesham states expressly that he came from
Worcester to Evesham on the 19th of October, and returned the next day
for London. In the course, however, of a very few months at the
latest, a commission to suppress the rebellion, and restore peace in
the northern counties of the Principality, was entrusted to an
individual whose character, and fortunes, and death, deeply involved
as they are in an eventful period of the history of our native
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page099" name="page099">(p. 099)</a></span>
land, could not but have recommended the part he then took in
Wales to our especial notice under any circumstances whatsoever;
whilst his name excites in us feelings of tenfold greater interest
when it offers itself in conjunction with the name of Henry of
Monmouth.</p>

<p>Henry Percy, eldest son of the Earl of Northumberland, known more
familiarly as <span class="smcap">Hotspur</span>,&mdash;a name which historians and poets have
preferred as characteristic of his decision, and zeal, and the
impetuosity of his disposition,&mdash;very shortly after Henry IV.'s
accession had been appointed not only Warden of the East Marches of
Scotland and Governor of Berwick, but also Chief Justice of North
Wales and Chester, and Constable of the Castles of Chester, Flint,
Conway, and Caernarvon. In this latter capacity, with the utmost
promptitude and decision, Hotspur exerted himself to the very best of
his power, at great personal labour and expense, to crush the
rebellion in its
infancy.<a id="notetag104" name="notetag104"></a><a href="#note104">[104]</a></p>

<p>The letters of this renowned and ill-fated nobleman, the originals of
which are preserved among the records of the Privy Council, seem to
have escaped the notice of our
historians.<a id="notetag105" name="notetag105"></a><a href="#note105">[105]</a>
They throw, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100">(p. 100)</a></span>
much light on the affairs of Wales and on Glyndowr's
rebellion at this early stage, and to the Biographer of Henry of
Monmouth are truly valuable. The first of these original papers, all
of which are beautifully corroborative of Hotspur's character as we
have received it, both from the notices of the historian and the
delineations of the poet, is dated Denbigh, April 10, 1401. It is
addressed to the King's council under feelings of annoyance that they
could have deemed it necessary to admonish him to exert himself in
putting down the insurgents, and restoring peace to the turbulent
districts over which his commission gave him authority. His character,
he presumes, ought to have been a pledge to them of his conduct. In
this letter there is not a shade of anything but devoted loyalty.</p>

<p>The reference which Hotspur makes in this first letter to "those of
the council of his most honoured and redoubted Prince being in these
parts," is perhaps the very earliest intimation we have of Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101">(p. 101)</a></span>
of Monmouth being himself personally engaged in suppressing the
rebellion in his principality, with the exception, at least, of the
inference to be fairly drawn from the acts of the Privy Council in the
preceding month. The King at his house, "Coldharbour," (the same which
he afterwards assigned to the Prince,) had assented to a proclamation
against the Welsh on the 13th of March; and on the 21st of March the
council had agreed to seal an instrument with the great seal,
authorizing the Prince himself to discharge any constables of the
castles who should neglect their duty, and not execute their office in
person. It is, however, to the second letter of Hotspur, dated
Caernarvon, May 3rd, 1401, that any one who takes a lively interest in
ascertaining the real character of Henry of Monmouth will find his
mind irresistibly drawn; he will meditate upon it again and again, and
with increasing interest as he becomes more familiar with the
circumstances under which it was written; and comparing it with the
prejudices almost universally adopted without suspicion and without
inquiry, will contemplate it with mingled feelings of surprise and
satisfaction. The name of Harry Hotspur, when set side by side with
the name of Harry of Monmouth, has been too long associated in the
minds of all who delight in English literature, with feelings of
unkindness and jealous rivalry. At the risk of anticipating what may
hereafter be established more at large, we cannot introduce this
document to the reader
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102">(p. 102)</a></span>
without saying that we hail the
preservation of this one, among the very few letters of Percy now
known to be in existence, with satisfaction and thankfulness. It is as
though history were destined of set purpose to correct the fascinating
misrepresentations of the poet, and to vindicate a character which has
been too long misunderstood. In the fictions of our dramatic poet
Hotspur is the very first to bear to Bolinbroke testimony of the
reckless, dissolute habits of Henry of
Monmouth.<a id="notetag106" name="notetag106"></a><a href="#note106">[106]</a>
Hotspur is the
very first whom the truth of history declares to have given direct and
voluntary evidence to the military talents of this same Prince, and
the kindness of his heart,&mdash;to his prowess at once and his mercy; the
combination of which two noble qualities characterizes his whole life,
and of which, blended in delightful harmony, his campaigns in Wales
supply this, by no means solitary, example. Hotspur informs the
council that North Wales, where he was holding his sessions, was
obedient to the law in all points, excepting the rebels in Conway, and
in Rees Castle which was in the mountains. "And these," continues
Percy, "will be well chastised, if it so please God, by the force and
governance which my redoubted lord the Prince has sent against them,
as well of his council as of his retinue, to besiege these rebels in
the said castles;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103">(p. 103)</a></span>
which siege, if it can be continued till
the said rebels be taken, will bring great ease and profit to the
governance of the same country in time to come." "Also," he proceeds,
"the commons of the said country of North Wales, that is, the counties
of Caernarvon and Merioneth, who have been before me at present, have
humbly offered their thanks to my lord the Prince for the great
exertions of his kindness and goodwill in procuring their pardon at
the hands of our sovereign lord the
King."<a id="notetag107" name="notetag107"></a><a href="#note107">[107]</a>
The pardon itself,
dated Westminster, 10th of March 1401, bears testimony to these
exertions of Prince Henry in behalf of the rebels: "Of our especial
grace, and at the prayer of our dearest first-born son, Henry Prince
of Wales, we have pardoned all treasons, rebellions,
&amp;c."<a id="notetag108" name="notetag108"></a><a href="#note108">[108]</a>
Henry
of Monmouth, when one of the first noblemen and most renowned warriors
of the age bears this testimony to his character for valour and for
kind-heartedness, had not quite completed his fourteenth year.</p>

<p>This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104">(p. 104)</a></span>
communication of Henry Percy, as remarkable as it is
interesting, appears to fix to the year 1401 the date of the
following, the very first letter known to exist from Henry of
Monmouth. It is dated Shrewsbury, May 15, and is addressed to the
Lords of the Council, whom he thanks for the kind attention paid by
them to all his wants during his absence in Wales. The epistle
breathes the spirit of a gallant young warrior full of promptitude and
intrepidity.<a id="notetag109" name="notetag109"></a><a href="#note109">[109]</a>
It may be surmised, perhaps, that the letter was
written by the Prince's secretary; and that the sentiments and turn of
thought here exhibited may, after all, be no fair test of his own
mind. But this is mere conjecture and assumption, requiring the
testimony of facts to confirm it: and, against it, we must observe,
that there is a simplicity, a raciness and an individuality of
character pervading Henry's letters which seem to stamp them for his
own. Especially do they stand out in broad contrast, when put side by
side with the equally characteristic despatches of Hotspur.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p><span class="smcap">LETTER OF PRINCE HENRY TO THE COUNCIL.</span></p>

<p>"Very dear and entirely well-beloved, we greet you much from our
     whole heart, thanking you very sincerely for the kind attention
     you have given to our wants during our absence; and we pray of
     you very earnestly the continuance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105">(p. 105)</a></span>
     of your good and
     friendly services, as our trust is in you. As to news from these
     parts, if you wish to hear of what has taken place, we were
     lately informed that Owyn Glyndowr [Oweyn de Glyndourdy] had
     assembled his forces, and those of other rebels, his adherents,
     in great numbers, purposing to commit inroads; and, in case of
     any resistance to his plans on the part of the English, to come
     to battle with them: and so he boasted to his own people.
     Wherefore we took our men, and went to a place of the said Owyn,
     well built, which was his chief mansion, called Saghern, where we
     thought we should have found him, if he wished to fight, as he
     said. And, on our arrival there, we found no person. So we caused
     the whole place to be set on fire, and many other houses around
     it, belonging to his tenants. And then we went straight to his
     other place of Glyndourdy, to seek for him there. There we burnt
     a fine lodge in his park, and the whole country round. And we
     remained there all that night. And certain of our people sallied
     forth, and took a gentleman of high degree of that country, who
     was one of the said Owyn's chieftains. This person offered five
     hundred pounds for his ransom to save his life, and to pay that
     sum within two weeks. Nevertheless that was not accepted, and he
     was put to death; and several of his companions, who were taken
     the same day, met with the same fate. We then proceeded to the
     commote of Edirnyon in Merionethshire, and there laid waste a
     fine and populous country; thence we went to Powys, and, there
     being in Wales a want of provender for horses, we made our people
     carry oats with them, and we tarried there for &mdash;--
days.<a id="notetag110" name="notetag110"></a><a href="#note110">[110]</a>
     And to give you fuller information of this expedition, and all
     other news from these parts at present, we send to you our
     well-beloved esquire, John de Waterton, to whom you will be
     pleased to give entire faith and credence in what he shall report
     to you on our
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106">(p. 106)</a></span>
     part with respect to the above-mentioned
     affair. And may our Lord have you always in his holy
     keeping.&mdash;Given under our signet, at Shrewsbury, the 15th day of
     May."
</p></div>

<p>Two days only after the date of this epistle, Hotspur despatched
another letter from Denbigh, which seems to convey the first
intimation of his dissatisfaction with the King's government; a
feeling which rapidly grew stronger, and led probably to the
subsequent outbreaking of his violence and rebellion. Hotspur presses
upon the council the perilous state of the Welsh Marches, at the same
time declaring that he could not endure the expense and labour then
imposed upon him more than one month longer; within four days at
furthest from the expiration of which time he must absolutely resign
his command.</p>

<p>In less than ten days after this despatch of Percy, the King's
proclamation mentions Owyn Glyndowr by name, as a rebel determined to
invade and ravage England. The King, announcing his own intention to
proceed the next day towards Worcester to crush the rebellion himself,
commands the sheriffs of various counties to join him with their
forces, wheresoever he might be. At this period the rebels entered
upon the campaign with surprising vigour. Many simultaneous assaults
appear to have been made against the English in different parts of the
borders. On the 28th of May a proclamation declares Glyndowr to be in
the Marches of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107">(p. 107)</a></span>
Caermarthen; and, only ten days before (May
18th), a commission was issued to attack the Welsh, who were besieging
William Beauchamp and his wife in the Castle of Abergavenny; whilst,
at the same time, the people of Salop were excused a subsidy, in
consideration of the vast losses they had sustained by the inroads of
the Welsh.</p>

1401.</h3>


<p>When Owyn Glyndowr raised the standard of rebellion in his native
land, and assuming to himself the name and state and powers of an
independent sovereign, under the title of "Prince of Wales," declared
war against Henry of Bolinbroke and his son, he was fully impressed
with the formidable power of his antagonists, and with the fate that
might await him should he fail in his attempt to rescue Wales from the
yoke of England. Embarked in a most perilous enterprise, a cause of
life or death, he vigorously entered on the task of securing every
promising means of success. His countrymen, whom he now called his
subjects, soon flocked to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109">(p. 109)</a></span>
his standard from all quarters.
Not only did those who were already in the Principality take up arms;
but numbers also who had left their homes, and were resident in
distant parts of the kingdom, returned forthwith as at the command of
their prince and liege lord. The Welsh
scholars,<a id="notetag111" name="notetag111"></a><a href="#note111">[111]</a>
who were
pursuing their studies in the University of Oxford, were summoned by
Owyn, and the names of some who obeyed the mandate are recorded. Owyn
at the same time negociated for assistance from France, with what
success we shall see hereafter; and sent also his emissaries to
Scotland and "the distant isles." On those of his countrymen who
espoused the cause of the King, and refused to join his standard, he
afterwards poured the full fury of his vengeance; and in the uncurbed
madness of his rage, forgetful of the future welfare of his native
land, and of his own interests should he be established as its prince,
unmindful also of the respect which even enemies pay to the sacred
edifices of the common faith, he reduced to ashes not only the houses
of his opponents, but Episcopal palaces, monasteries, and cathedrals
within the Principality.</p>

<p>Owyn Glyndowr was in a short time so well supported by an army,
undisciplined no doubt, and in all respects ill appointed, but yet
devoted to him and their common cause, that he was emboldened to try
his strength with Lord Grey in the field. A
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110">(p. 110)</a></span>
battle, fought
(as it should seem) in the very neighbourhood of
Glyndowrdy,<a id="notetag112" name="notetag112"></a><a href="#note112">[112]</a>
terminated in favour of Owyn, who took the Earl prisoner, and carried
him into the fastnesses of Snowdon. The precise date of this conflict
is not known; probably it was at the opening of spring: the
circumstances also of his capture are very differently represented. It
is generally asserted that a marriage with one of Owyn's daughters was
the condition of regaining his liberty proposed to the Earl; that the
marriage was solemnized; and that Owyn then, instead of keeping his
word and releasing him, demanded of him a most exorbitant ransom. It
is, moreover, affirmed, that the Earl remained Glyndowr's prisoner to
the day of his death. Now, that Lord Grey fell into the Welsh
chieftain's hands as a prisoner, is beyond question; so it is that he
paid a heavy ransom: but that he died in confinement is certainly not
true, for he accompanied Henry V. to France, and also served him by
sea. The report of his marriage with Owyn's daughter, might have
originated in some confusion of Lord Grey with Sir Edmund Mortimer;
who unquestionably did take one of the Welsh chieftain's daughters for
his
wife.<a id="notetag113" name="notetag113"></a><a href="#note113">[113]</a>
It is scarcely probable that both Owyn's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111">(p. 111)</a></span>
prisoners should have married his daughters; and still less probable
that he should have exacted so large a ransom from his son-in-law as
to exhaust his means, and prevent him from acting as a baron of the
realm was then expected to act. Dugdale's Baronage gives the Earl two
wives, without naming the daughter of Glyndowr. Hardyng, in his
Chronicle presented to Henry VI, thus describes the affair:</p>

<p class="poem">
Soone after was the same Lord Gray in feelde<br>
Fightyng taken, and holden prisoner<br>
By Owayne, so that hym in prison helde<br>
Till his ransom was made, and fynaunce clear,<br>
Ten thousand marks, and fully payed were;<br>
For whiche he was so poor then all his life,<br>
That no power he had to war, nor stryfe.</p>


<p>Another letter from Henry Percy to the council, dated June 4, 1401, is
very interesting in several points of view. It proves that the
negociations "carried in and out," mentioned in a letter written by
the chamberlain of Caernarvon to the King's council, had been
successful, and that the Scots had sent aid to the Welsh chieftain: it
proves also that Hotspur himself was at this time (though bitterly
dissatisfied) carrying on the war for the King in the very heart of
Wales, and amidst its mountain-recesses and strongholds; and that Owyn
was at that time assailed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112">(p. 112)</a></span>
on all sides by the English
forces, a circumstance which might probably have led to his "good
intention to return to his allegiance," at the close of the present
year. Henry Percy declares to the council that he can support the
expenses of the campaign no longer. He informs them of an engagement
in which, assisted by Sir Hugh Browe and the Earl of Arundel, the only
Lords Marchers who had joined him in the expedition, he had a few days
before routed the Welsh at Cader Idris. News, he adds, had just
reached him of a victory gained by Lord
Powis<a id="notetag114" name="notetag114"></a><a href="#note114">[114]</a>
over Owyn; also
that an English vessel had been retaken from the Scots, and a Scotch
vessel of war had been captured at Milford. Another letter, dated 3rd
July, (probably the same year, 1401,) reiterates his complaints of
non-payment of his forces, and of the government having underrated his
services; it expresses his hope also that, since he had written to the
King himself with a statement of his destitute condition, should any
evil happen to castle, town, or march, the blame would not be cast on
him, whose means were so utterly crippled, but would fall on the heads
of those who refused the supplies. Henry IV. had certainly not
neglected this rebellion in Wales, though evidently the measures
adopted against the insurgents were not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113">(p. 113)</a></span>
so vigorous at the
commencement as the urgency of the case required. His exchequer was
exhausted, and he had other business in hand to drain off the supplies
as fast as they could possibly be collected. He was, therefore,
contented for the present to keep the rebels in check, without
attempting to crush them by pouring in an overwhelming force from
different points at once.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of this summer, the King marched in person to
Worcester. He had directed the sheriffs to forward their contingents
thither; but, when he arrived at that city, he changed his purpose and
soon returned to London. Among the considerations which led to this
change in his plans, we may probably reckon the following. In the
first place, he found his son the Prince, Lord Powis, and Henry Percy,
in vigorous operation against the rebels; his arrival at Worcester
having been only three or four days after the date of Percy's last
letter. In the next place, the council had urged him not to go in
person against the rebels: besides, almost all the inhabitants of
North Wales had returned to their allegiance, and had been pardoned.
He was, moreover, naturally anxious to summon a parliament, with a
view of replenishing his exhausted treasury, and enabling himself to
enter upon the campaign with means more calculated to insure success.</p>

<p>In a letter to his council, dated Worcester, 8th June 1401, the King
refers to two points of advice suggested
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114">(p. 114)</a></span>
by them. "Inasmuch
as you have advised us," he says, "to write to our much beloved son,
the Prince, and to others, who may have in their possession any jewels
which ought to be delivered with our cousin the Queen, (Isabella,)
know ye, that we will send to our said son, that, if he has any of
such jewels, he will send them with all possible speed to you at our
city of London, where, if God will, we intend to be in our own person
before the Queen's departure; and we will cause to be delivered to her
there the rest of the said jewels, which we and others our children
have in our keeping." In answer to their advice that he would not go
in person against the rebels, because they were not in sufficient
strength, and of too little reputation to warrant that step, he said
that he found they had risen in great numbers, and called for his
personal exertions. He forwarded to them at the same time a copy of
the letter which he had just received from Owyn himself. Not from this
correspondence only, but from other undisputed documents, and from the
loud complaints of French
writers,<a id="notetag115" name="notetag115"></a><a href="#note115">[115]</a>
we are compelled to infer
something extremely unsatisfactory in the conduct of Henry IV. with
regard to the valuable paraphernalia of Isabella, the maiden-widow of
Richard. To avoid restoring these treasures, which fell into his hands
on the capture of that unfortunate monarch,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115">(p. 115)</a></span>
Henry proposed,
in November 1399, a marriage between one of his sons and one of the
daughters of the French monarch. In January 1400 a truce was signed
between the two kingdoms, and the same negociators (the Bishop of
Durham and the Earl of Worcester) were directed to treat with the
French ambassadors on the terms of the restitution of Isabella; and so
far did they immediately proceed, that horses were ordered for her
journey to Dover. But legal doubts as to her dower (she not being
twelve years of age) postponed her departure till the next year. She
had arrived at Boulogne certainly on the 1st of August 1401; and was
afterwards delivered up to her friends by the Earl of Worcester, with
the solemn assurance of her spotless purity.</p>

<p>It is impossible to glance at this lady's brief and melancholy career
without feelings of painful interest:&mdash;espoused when yet a child to
the reigning monarch of England; whilst yet a child, crowned Queen of
England; whilst yet a child, become a virgin-widow; when she was not
yet seventeen years old, married again to Charles, Earl of Angouleme;
and three years afterwards, before she reached the twentieth
anniversary of her birthday, dying in
childbed.<a id="notetag116" name="notetag116"></a><a href="#note116">[116]</a></p>

<p>By
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116">(p. 116)</a></span>
the above letter of the King, which led to this
digression, we are informed that the Prince was neither with his
father, nor in London; for the King promised to write to him to send
the jewels to London. He was probably at that time on the borders of
North Wales; or engaged in reducing the Castles of Conway and Rhees,
and in bringing that district into subjection. Indeed, that the Prince
was still personally exerting himself in suppressing the Welsh towards
the north of the Principality, seems to be put beyond all question by
the records of the Privy Council, which state that "certain members of
the Prince's council brought with them to the King's council the
indenture between the said Prince and Henry Percy the son (Chief
Justice) on one part, and those who seized the
Castle<a id="notetag117" name="notetag117"></a><a href="#note117">[117]</a> of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117">(p. 117)</a></span>
Conway on the other part, made at the time of the restitution of the
same castle."<a id="notetag118" name="notetag118"></a>
<a href="#note118">[118]</a></p>

<p>Owyn appears to have left his own country, in which the spirit of
rebellion had received a considerable though temporary check; and to
have been at this period exciting and heading the rebels in South
Wales, especially about Caermarthen and Gower.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Hotspur himself left Wales probably about the July or August of this
year, 1401; for on the 1st of September he was appointed one of the
commissioners to treat with the Scots for peace; and he was present at
the solemn espousals which were celebrated by proxy at Eltham, April
3, 1402, between Henry IV. and Joan of Navarre. We must, therefore,
refer to a subsequent date the information quoted by Sir Henry Ellis
from an original paper in the British Museum, "that Jankin Tyby of the
north
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118">(p. 118)</a></span>
countri bringthe lettres owte of the northe country to
Owein, as thei demed from Henr. son Percy." Soon after the departure
of Percy, a proclamation, dated 18th September 1401, notifies the
rapid progress of disaffection and rebellion among the Welsh: whether
it was secretly encouraged by him at this early date, or not, is
matter only of conjecture. His growing discontent, visibly shown in
his own letters, this vague rumour that Jankin Tyby might be the
confidential messenger for his treasonable purposes, and his
subsequent conduct, combine to render the suspicion by no means
improbable. The proclamation states that a great part of the
inhabitants of Wales had gone over to Owyn, and commands all
ablebodied men to meet the King at Worcester on the 1st, or, at the
furthest, the 2nd of October. Perhaps this, like his former visit to
Worcester, was little more than a demonstration of his
force.<a id="notetag119" name="notetag119"></a><a href="#note119">[119]</a>
Historians generally say that he made the first of his expeditions
into Wales in the July of the following year; the Minutes of Council
prove at all events that he was there in the present autumn, but how
long or with what results does not appear. The council met
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119">(p. 119)</a></span>
in
November 1401, to deliberate, among other subjects, upon the affairs
of Wales, "from which country (as the Minute expressly states) our
sovereign lord the King hath but lately
returned,<a id="notetag120" name="notetag120"></a><a href="#note120">[120]</a>
having
appointed the Earl of Worcester to be Lieutenant of South Wales, and
Captain of
Cardigan."<a id="notetag121" name="notetag121"></a><a href="#note121">[121]</a></p>

<p>The record of this council is remarkably interesting on more than one
point. It throws great light on the state of Owyn's mind, and his
attachment to the Percies; on the confidence still reposed by the
King's government in Percy, and on the condition of Prince Henry
himself. The several chastisements which Owyn and his party had
received from the Prince, from Percy, from Lord Powis and others, had
perhaps at this time made him very doubtful of the issue of the
struggle, and inclined him to negociate for his own pardon, and the
peace
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120">(p. 120)</a></span>
of the country. The Minute of Council says, "To know
the King's will about treating with Glyndowr to return to his
allegiance, <i>seeing his good intention at present thereto</i>." His
readiness to treat is accompanied, as we find in the same record, with
a declaration that he was not himself the cause of the destruction
going on in his native land, nor of the daily captures, and the
murders there; and that he would most gladly return to peace. As to
his inheritance, he protests that he had only received a part, and not
his own full right. And even now he would willingly come to the
borders, and speak and treat with any lords, provided the commons
would not raise a rumour and clamour that he was purposed to destroy
"<i>all who spoke the English language</i>." He seems to have been
apprehensive, should he venture to approach the marches to negociate a
peace, that the violence and rage of the people at large would
endanger his personal safety. No wonder, for his footsteps were to be
traced everywhere by the blood of men, and the ashes of their
habitations and sacred edifices. At the same time, he expressed his
earnest desire to carry on the treaty of peace through the Earl of
Northumberland, for whom he professes to entertain great regard and
esteem, in preference to any other English nobleman.</p>

<p>Whether any steps were taken in consequence of this present opening
for peace, or not, we are not told. But we have reason to suppose that
Wales was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121">(p. 121)</a></span>
in comparative tranquillity through the following
winter<a id="notetag122" name="notetag122"></a><a href="#note122">[122]</a>
and spring. The rebel chief, however, again very shortly
carried the sword and flame with increased horrors through his devoted
native land. We read of no battle or skirmish till the campaign of the
next year.</p>

<p>The questions relating to Prince Henry, which were submitted to this
council, inform us incidentally of the important fact, that though he
was now intrusted with the command of the forces against the Welsh,
and was assisted in his office (just as was the King) by a council,
yet it was deemed right to appoint him an especial governor, or tutor
(maistre). He was now in his fifteenth year. These Minutes also make
it evident that the soldiers employed in his service looked for their
pay to him, and not to the King's exchequer. We shall have frequent
occasion to observe the great personal inconveniences to which this
practice subjected the Prince, and how injurious it was to the service
generally. But the evil was unavoidable; for at that time the royal
exchequer was quite drained.</p>

<p>"As to the article touching the governance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122">(p. 122)</a></span>
Prince, as
well for him to have a tutor or guardian, as to provide money for the
support of his vast expenses in the garrisons of his castles in Wales,
and the wages of his men-at-arms and archers, whom he keeps from day
to day for resisting the malice of the rebels of the King, it appears
to the council, if it please the King, that the Isle of Anglesey ought
to be restored to the prince, and that Henry
Percy<a id="notetag123" name="notetag123"></a><a href="#note123">[123]</a>
should agree,
and have compensation from the issues of the lands which belonged to
the Earl of March; and that all other possessions which ought to
belong to the Prince should be restored, and an amicable arrangement
be made with those in whose hands they are. And as for a governor for
the Prince, may it please the King to choose one of these,&mdash;the Earl
of Worcester, Lord Lovel, Mr. Thomas Erpyngham, or the Lord Say; and,
for the Prince's expenses, that 1000<i>l.</i> be assigned from the rents of
the Earl of March, which were due about last Michaelmas." We have
reason to believe that the Earl of Worcester, Thomas Percy, was
appointed Henry of Monmouth's tutor and preceptor. He remained in
attendance upon him till, with the guilt of aggravated treachery, he
abruptly left his prince and pupil to join his nephew Hotspur before
the battle of Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>We
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123">(p. 123)</a></span>
are not informed how long Prince Henry remained at this
period in Wales, after Percy had left it. Probably (as it has been
already intimated) there was an armistice virtually, though not by any
formal agreement, through that winter and the spring of 1402. The next
undoubted information as to the Prince fixes him in London in the
beginning of the following May, when being in the Tower, in the
presence of his father, and with his consent, he declares himself
willing to contract a marriage with Katharine, sister of Eric, King of
Norway;<a id="notetag124" name="notetag124"></a><a href="#note124">[124]</a>
 and on the 26th of the same month, being then in his
castle of Tutbury, in the diocese of Lincoln, he confirms this
contract, and authorises the notary public to affix his seal to the
agreement. The pages of authentic history remind us, that too many
marriage-contracts in every rank of life, and in every age of the
world, have been the result, not of mutual affection between the
affianced bride and bridegroom, but of pecuniary and political
considerations. Perhaps when kings negociate and princes approve,
their exalted station renders the transaction more notorious, and the
stipulated conditions may be more unreservedly confessed. But it may
well be doubted whether the same motives do not equally operate in
every grade of life; whilst those objects which should
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124">(p. 124)</a></span>
be
primary and indispensable, are regarded as secondary and contingent.
Happiness springing from mutual affection, may doubtless grow and
ripen, despite of such arrangements, in the families of the noble, the
wealthy, the middle classes, and the poor; but the chances are
manifold more, that coldness, and dissatisfaction, and mutual
carelessness of each other's comforts will be the permanent result. We
must however bear in mind, when estimating the moral worth of an
individual, that negociations of this kind in the palaces of kings
imply nothing of that cold-heartedness by which many are led into
connexions from which their affections revolt. The individual's
character seems altogether protected from reprobation by the usage of
the world, and the necessity of the case. State-considerations impose
on princes restraints, compelling them to acquiesce in measures which
excite in us other feelings than indignation or contempt. We regret
the circumstance, but we do not condemn the parties. Henry IV. of
England, and Eric of Norway, fancied they saw political advantages
likely to arise from the nuptials of Henry's son with Eric's sister;
and the document we have just quoted tells us that the boy Henry, then
not fifteen, and still under tutors and governors, gave his consent to
the proposed alliance.</p>

<p>The more rare however the occurrence, the more general is the
admiration with which an union in the palaces of monarchy is
contemplated when mutual
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125">(p. 125)</a></span>
respect and attachment precede the
marriage, and conjugal love and domestic happiness attend it. And here
we are irresistibly tempted to contemplate with satisfaction and
delight the unsuccessful issue of this negociation, whilst Henry was
yet a boy; and to anticipate what must be repeated in its place, that,
to whatever combination of circumstances, and course of events and
state-considerations, the marriage of Henry of Monmouth with Katharine
of France may possibly be referred, he proved himself to have formed
for her a most sincere and heartfelt attachment before their union;
and, whenever his duty did not separate them, to have lived with her
in the possession of great conjugal felicity. Even the dry details of
the Exchequer issues bear most gratifying, though curious, testimony
to their domestic habits, and their enjoyment of each other's society.</p>

<p>Whilst the King was thus negociating a marriage for his son, he was
himself engaged by solemn espousals to marry, as his second wife, Joan
of Navarre, Duchess of Brittany. As well in the most exalted, as in the
most humble family in the realm, such an event as this can never take
place without involving consequences of deepest moment and most lively
interest to all parties,&mdash;to the husband, to his wife, and to their
respective children. If he has been happy in his choice, a man cannot
provide a more substantial blessing for his offspring than by joining
himself by the most sacred of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126">(p. 126)</a></span> all ties to a woman who will
cheerfully and lovingly perform the part of a conscientious and
affectionate mother towards them. If the choice is unhappy; if there be
a want of sound religious and moral principle, a neglect, or
carelessness and impatience in the discharge of domestic duties; if a
discontented, suspicious, cold, and unkind spirit accompany the new
bride, domestic comfort must take flight, and all the proverbial evils
of such a state must be realized. The marriage of Henry of Monmouth's
father with Joan of Navarre does not enable us to view the bright side
of this alternative. Of the new Queen we hear little for many years;<a
id="notetag125" name="notetag125"></a><a href="#note125">[125]</a> but,
at the end of those years
of comparative silence, we find Henry V. compelled to remove from his
mother-in-law all her attendants, and to commit her to the custody of
Lord John Pelham in the castle of Pevensey.<a id="notetag126" name="notetag126"></a>
<a href="#note126">[126]</a> She was charged with
having entertained malicious and treasonable designs against the life of
the King, her son-in-law. The Chronicle of London, (1419,) throwing<a
id="notetag127" name="notetag127"></a><a href="#note127">[127]</a> an air
of mystery and
superstition over the whole affair, asserts that Queen Joanna excited
her confessor, one <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127"
name="page127">(p. 127)</a></span> friar Randolf,<a id="notetag128"
name="notetag128"></a><a href="#note128">[128]</a> a master in divinity,
to destroy the King; "but, as God would, his falseness was at last
espied:" "wherefore," as the Chronicle adds, "the Queen forfeited her
lands."<a id="notetag129" name="notetag129"></a><a href="#note129">[129]</a>
Of this marriage of Henry IV. with Joan of Navarre very
little notice beyond the bare fact has been taken by our English
historians. Many particulars, however, are found in the histories of
Brittany. It appears that the Duchess, who was the widow of Philip de
Mont Forte, Duke of Brittany, by whom she had sons and daughters, was
solemnly contracted to Henry by her proxy, Anthony Rys, at Eltham, on
the 3rd of April 1402, in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Earl of Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland and his son Hotspur,
the Earl of Worcester, Thomas Langley, Keeper of the Privy Seal, and
others. Having appointed guardians for her son, the young Duke of
Brittany, she left Nantes on the 26th December, embarked on
<span class="pagenum"><a
id="page128" name="page128">(p. 128)</a></span> board one of the
ships sent by
Henry, at Camaret, on the 13th January, and sailed the next day,
intending to land at Southampton. After a stormy passage of five days,
the squadron was forced into a port in Cornwall. She was married on the
7th, and was crowned at Westminster on the 25th, of February
following.<a id="notetag130" name="notetag130"></a><a href="#note130">[130]</a>
By Henry she had no child.</p>

1402-1403.</h3>


<p>If Owyn Glyndowr, as we have supposed, allowed Wales to remain
undisturbed by battles and violence through the
winter<a id="notetag131" name="notetag131"></a><a href="#note131">[131]</a>
and
spring, it was only to employ the time in preparing for a more
vigorous campaign. The first battle of which we have any historical
certainty, was fought June 12, 1402, near Melienydd, (Dugdale says,
"upon the mountain called Brynglas, near Knighton in Melenyth,") in
Radnorshire. The whole array of Herefordshire was routed on that
field. More than one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130">(p. 130)</a></span>
thousand Englishmen were slain, on whom
the Welsh were guilty of savage, unheard-of indignities. The women
especially gave vent to their rage and fury by actions too disgraceful
to be credible were they not recorded as uncontradicted facts. For the
honour of the sex, we wish to regard them as having happened only
once; whilst we would bury the disgusting details in
oblivion.<a id="notetag132" name="notetag132"></a><a href="#note132">[132]</a>
Owyn was victorious, and took many of high degree prisoners; among
whom was Sir Edmund Mortimer, the uncle of the Earl of March. Perhaps
the most authentic statement of this victory as to its leading
features, though without any details, is found in a letter from the
King to his council, dated Berkhampstead, June 25.</p>

<p>"The rebels have taken my beloved
cousin,<a id="notetag133" name="notetag133"></a><a href="#note133">[133]</a>
Esmon Mortymer, and
many other knights and esquires. We are resolved, consequently, to go
in our
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131">(p. 131)</a></span>
own person with God's permission. You will therefore
command all in our retinue and pay to meet us at Lichfield, where we
intend to be at the latest on the 7th of July." The proclamation for
an array "to meet the King at Lichfield, and proceed with him towards
Wales to check the insolence and malice of Owyn Glyndowr and other
rebels," was issued the same day. On the 5th of
July,<a id="notetag134" name="notetag134"></a><a href="#note134">[134]</a>
the King,
being at Westminster, appointed Hugh de Waterton governor of his
children, John and Philippa, till his return from Wales. An order of
council at Westminster, on the last day of July, the King himself
being present, seems to leave us no alternative in deciding that Henry
made two expeditions to Wales this summer; the first at the
commencement of July, the second towards the end of August. This
appears to have escaped the observation of historians. Walsingham
speaks only of one,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132">(p. 132)</a></span>
and that before the Feast of the
Assumption, August 25; in which he represents the King and his army to
have been well-nigh destroyed by storms of rain, snow, and hail, so
terrible as to have excited the belief that they were raised by the
machination of the devil, and of course at Owyn's bidding. This order
of council is directed to many sheriffs, commanding them to proclaim
an array through their several counties to meet the King at
Shrewsbury,<a id="notetag135" name="notetag135"></a><a href="#note135">[135]</a>
on the 27th of August at the latest, to proceed with
him into
Wales.<a id="notetag136" name="notetag136"></a><a href="#note136">[136]</a>
The order declares the necessity of this second
array to have originated in the impossibility, through the shortness
of the time, of the King's chastising the rebels, who lurked in
mountains and woods; and states his determination to be there again
shortly, and to remain fifteen days for the final overthrow and
destruction of his enemies. How lamentably he was mistaken in his
calculation of their resistance, and his own powers of subjugating
them, the sequel proved to him too clearly. The rebellion from first
to last was protracted through almost as many years as the days he had
numbered for its utter extinction.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133">(p. 133)</a></span>
The order on the sheriff
of Derby commands him to go with his contingent to Chester, "to our
dearest son the Prince," on the 27th of August, and to advance in his
retinue to Wales. On this
occasion,<a id="notetag137" name="notetag137"></a><a href="#note137">[137]</a>
it is said that Henry invaded
Wales in three points at once, himself commanding one division of his
army, the second being headed by the Prince, the third by Lord
Arundel. The details of these measures, under the personal
superintendence of the King, are not found in history. Probably
Walsingham's account of their total failure must be admitted as
nearest the truth. That no material injury befel Owyn from them, and
that neither were his means crippled, nor his resolution daunted, is
testified by the inroads which, not long after, he made into England
with redoubled impetuosity.</p>

<p>The following winter, we may safely conclude, was spent by the Welsh
chieftain in negociations both with the malcontent lords of England,
and with the courts of France and Scotland; in recruiting his forces
and improving his means of
warfare;<a id="notetag138" name="notetag138"></a><a href="#note138">[138]</a>
for, before the next
midsummer, (as we know on the best authority,) he was prepared to
engage in an expedition into England, with a power too formidable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134">(p. 134)</a></span>
for the Prince and his retinue to resist without further
reinforcement. During this winter also a most important accession
accrued to the power and influence of Owyn by the defection from the
royal cause of his prisoner Sir Edmund Mortimer, who became devotedly
attached to him. King Henry had, we are told, refused to allow a
ransom to be paid for Mortimer, though urged to it by Henry Percy, who
had married Mortimer's sister. The consequence of this ungracious
refusal<a id="notetag139" name="notetag139"></a><a href="#note139">[139]</a>
was, that he joined Glyndowr, whose daughter, as the Monk
of Evesham informs us, he married with the greatest solemnity about
the end of
November.<a id="notetag140" name="notetag140"></a><a href="#note140">[140]</a>
In a fortnight after this marriage, Mortimer
announced to his tenants his junction with Owyn, and called upon them
to forward his views. The letter, written in French, is preserved in
the British Museum.</p>


<div class="letter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135">(p. 135)</a></span>
     <span class="smcap">LETTER FROM EDMUND MORTIMER TO HIS TENANTS.</span>

<p>"Very dear and well-beloved, I greet you much, and make known to
     you that Oweyn Glyndor has raised a quarrel, of which the object
     is, if King Richard be alive, to restore him to his crown; and if
     not, that my honoured nephew, who is the right heir to the said
     crown, shall be King of England, and that the said Owen will
     assert his right in Wales. And I, seeing and considering that the
     said quarrel is good and reasonable, have consented to join in
     it, and to aid and maintain it, and, by the grace of God, to a
     good end. Amen! I ardently hope, and from my heart, that you will
     support and enable me to bring this struggle of mine to a
     successful issue. I have moreover to inform you that the
     lordships of Mellenyth, Werthrenon, Raydre, the commot of Udor,
     Arwystly, Keveilloc, and Kereynon, are lately come into our
     possession. Wherefore I moreover entreat you that you will
     forbear making inroad into my said lands, or to do any damage to
     my said tenantry, and that you furnish them with provisions at a
     certain reasonable price, as you would wish that I should treat
     you; and upon this point be pleased to send me an answer. Very
     dear and well-beloved, God give you grace to prosper in your
     beginnings, and to arrive at a happy issue.&mdash;Written at
     Mellenyth, the 13th day of December.<br>

  <span class="smcap left50">"Edmund Mortimer."</span></p>

<a href="#note141">[141]</a></p></div>




<p>Of the Prince himself, between the end of August 1402, and the
following spring, little is recorded. In March 1403 he was made
Lieutenant of Wales by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136">(p. 136)</a></span>
the King, and with the consent of his
council, with full powers of inquiring into offences, of pardoning
offenders, of arraying the King's lieges, and of doing all other
things which he should find necessary. This appointment, implying
personal interference, would lead us to infer, either that he tarried
through the winter in the midst of the Principality, or near its
borders, or that he returned to it early in the
spring.<a id="notetag142" name="notetag142"></a><a href="#note142">[142]</a>
To this
year also we shall probably be correct in referring the following
letter of Prince Henry to the council, dated Shrewsbury, 30th May; but
which Sir Harris Nicolas considers to have been written the year
before. That it could not have been written by the Prince at
Shrewsbury on the 30th of May 1402, seems demonstrable from the
circumstance of his having been personally present in the Tower of
London on the 8th of May, and of his having executed a deed in the
Castle of Tutbury on the 26th of May 1402. Whilst the probability of
its having been written in the end of May 1403, is much strengthened
by the ordinance of the King, dated June 16, 1403, in which he
mentions the reports which he had received from the Prince's council
then in Wales of Owyn Glyndowr's intention to invade England; and also
by the order made July 10, 1403, by the King, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137">(p. 137)</a></span>
the
council would send 1000<i>l.</i> to the Prince, to enable him to keep his
people together,&mdash;the very object chiefly desired in this despatch.
The letter is in French.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p><span class="smcap">LETTER FROM PRINCE HENRY TO THE COUNCIL.</span></p>

<p>
     "<span class="smcap">From the Prince.</span></p>
<p>
     "Very dear and entirely well-beloved, we greet you well. And
     forasmuch as our soldiers desire to know from us whether they
     will be paid for the three months of the present quarter, and
     tell us that they will not remain here without being promptly
     paid their wages according to their agreements, we beseech you
     very sincerely that you will order payment for the said months,
     or supply us otherwise, and take measures in time for the
     safeguard of these marches. For the rebels are trying to find out
     every day whether we shall be paid, and they well know that
     without payment we shall not be able to continue here: and they
     propose to levy all the power of Northwales and Southwales to
     make inroads, and to destroy the march and the counties adjoining
     to it; and we have not the power here of resisting them, so as to
     hinder them from the full execution of their malicious designs.
     And when our men are withdrawn from us, we must at all events
     ourselves retire into England, or be disgraced for ever. For
     every one must know that without troops we can do no more than
     another man of inferior rank. And at present we have very great
     expenses, and we have raised the largest sum in our power to meet
     them from our little stock of jewels. Our two castles of Harlech
     and Lampadern are besieged, and have been so for a long time, and
     we must relieve them and victual them within these ten days; and,
     besides that, protect the march around us with the third of our
     forces against the invasion of the rebels. Nevertheless, if this
     campaign could be continued, the rebels never were so likely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138">(p. 138)</a></span>
     to be destroyed as at present. And now, since we have fully
     shown the state of these districts, please to take such measures
     as shall seem best to you for the safety of these same parts, and
     of this portion of the realm of England; which may God protect,
     and give you grace to determine upon the best for the time. And
     our Lord have you in his keeping.&mdash;Given under our signet at
     Shrewsbury, the 30th day of May. And be well assured that we have
     fully shown to you the peril of whatever may happen hereafter, if
     remedy be not sent in time.
</p></div>

<p>On this letter it is impossible not to remark that, so far from having
an abundant supply of money to squander on his supposed vices and
follies, Henry was compelled to pawn his own little stock of plate and
jewels to raise money for the indispensable expenses of the war.</p>

<p>The first direct mention made of the Prince after this is found in the
ordinance above referred to, dated June 16, 1403, which informs us
that he certainly was then in Wales, and strongly implies that he had
been there for some time previously. The King says, "I heard from many
persons of my son the Prince's council, now in Wales, that Owyn
Glyndowr is on the point of making an incursion into England with a
great power, for the purpose of obtaining supplies. I therefore
command the sheriffs of Gloucester, Salop, Worcester, and Hereford, to
make proclamation for all knights, and gentlemen of one hundred
shillings' annual income, to go and put themselves under the
governance of the Prince." Another letter from Henry to his council,
dated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139">(p. 139)</a></span>
Higham Ferrers, July 10,
1403,<a id="notetag143" name="notetag143"></a><a href="#note143">[143]</a>
is deeply
interesting, not only as bearing testimony to the persevering bravery
of his son Henry, but as affording an example of the uncertainty of
human calculations, and the deceitfulness of human engagements and
friendships. He informs the council that he had received letters from
his son, and information by his messengers, acquainting him with the
gallant and good bearing of his very dear and well-beloved son, which
gave him very great pleasure. He then commissions them to pay
1000<i>l.</i><a id="notetag144" name="notetag144"></a>
<a href="#note144">[144]</a>
 to the Prince for the purpose of enabling him to keep
his soldiers together. "We are now," he adds, "on our way to succour
our beloved and loyal cousins, the Earl of Northumberland and Henry
his son, in the conflict which they have honourably undertaken for us
and our realm; and, as soon as that campaign shall have ended
honourably, with the aid of God, we will hasten towards
Wales."<a id="notetag145" name="notetag145"></a><a href="#note145">[145]</a></p>

<p>This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140">(p. 140)</a></span>
letter had not been written more than five days when
King Henry became acquainted with the rebellion of those, his "beloved
and faithful lieges," to assist whom against his northern foes he was
then actually on his road. His proclamation for all sheriffs to raise
their counties, and hasten to him wherever he might be, is dated
Burton-on-Trent, July 16, 1403. On the morrow he sent off a despatch
to his council, informing them that Henry Percy, calling him only
Henry of Lancaster, was in open rebellion against him, and was
spreading far and wide through Cheshire the false rumours that Richard
was still alive. He then assures them, "for their consolation," that
he was powerful enough to encounter all his enemies; at the same time
expressing his pleasure that they should all come to him wherever he
might be, except only the Treasurer, whom he wished to stay, for the
purpose of collecting as large sums as possible to meet the exigence
of the occasion. The Chancellor, on Wednesday, June 18th, met the
bearer of these tidings before he reached London, opened the letters,

1403.</h3>


<p>In analysing the motives which drove the Percies, father and son, into
rebellion, we are recommended by some writers to search only into
those antecedent probabilities, those general causes of mutual
dissatisfaction, which must have operated on parties situated as they
were with regard to Henry IV. The same authors would dissuade us from
seeking for any immediate and proximate causes, because "chroniclers
have not discovered or detailed the beginning incidents." But we shall
scarcely be able to do justice to our subject if we strictly follow
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142">(p. 142)</a></span>
this prescribed rule of inquiry. The general causes
enumerated by Hume, and expatiated upon in modern times, we may take
for granted. Undoubtedly ingratitude on the one side, and discontent
on the other, were not only to be expected, but, as we know, actually
prevailed. "The sovereign naturally became jealous of that power which
had advanced him to the throne, and the subject was not easily
satisfied in the returns which he thought so great a favour had
merited." But we are by no means left to conjecture abstractedly on
the "beginning incidents," as the proximate causes of the open revolt
of the family of Percy have been called: Hotspur's own letters, as
well as those of his father Northumberland, the existence of which
seems not to have been known to our historians, prepare us for much of
what actually took place. We have already observed the indications of
wounded pride, and indignation, and utter discontent, which Hotspur's
despatches from Wales evince. Another communication, dated Swyneshed,
in Lincolnshire, July 3, is more characteristic of his temper of mind
than the preceding, and makes his subsequent conduct still more easily
understood.<a id="notetag147" name="notetag147"></a><a href="#note147">[147]</a>
Sir Harris
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143">(p. 143)</a></span>
Nicolas has so clearly analysed
this letter, that we may well content ourselves with the substance of
it as we find it in his valuable preface.</p>

<p>"Hotspur commenced by reminding the council of his repeated
applications for payment of the money due to him as Warden of the East
March; and then alluded to the other sums owing to his father and
himself, and to the promise made by the treasurer, when he was last in
London, that, if it were agreeable to the council, 2,000 marks should
be paid him before the February then last past. He said he had heard
that at the last parliament, when the necessities of the realm were
explained by the lords of the great council to the barons and commons,
the war allowance was demanded for all the marches, Calais, Guienne
and Scotland, the sea, and Ireland; that the proposition for the
Scotch marches was limited to 37,000<i>l.</i>; and that, as the payment for
the marches in time of truce, due to his father and to him, did not
exceed 5,000<i>l.</i> per annum, it excited his astonishment that it could
not be paid in good faith; that it appeared to him either that the
council attached too little consideration to the said marches, where
the most formidable enemies which they had would be found, or that
they were not satisfied with his and his father's services therein;
but, if they made proper inquiry, he hoped that the greatest neglect
they would discover in the marches was the neglect of payment, without
which they would find no one who could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144">(p. 144)</a></span>
render such service.
On this subject he had, he said, written to the King, entreating him
that, if any injury occurred to town, castle, or march, in his charge,
from default of payment, he might not be blamed; but that the censure
should rest on those who would not pay him, agreeably to his Majesty's
honourable command and desire. He begged the council not to be
displeased that he wrote ignorantly in his rude and feeble manner on
this subject, because he was compelled to do so by the necessities not
merely of himself, but of his soldiers, who were in such distress,
that, without providing a remedy, he neither could nor dared to go to
the marches; and he concluded by requesting the council to take such
measures as they might think proper."</p>

<p>Two letters from the Earl of Northumberland, the one to the council in
May, the other to the King, dated 26th June 1403, breathe the same
spirit with those of his son Hotspur, and would have led us to
anticipate the same subsequent conduct; at least they ought to have
prepared the King and council for the resentments of two such men,
overflowing with bitter indignation at the neglect and injustice with
which they considered themselves to have been treated.</p>

<p>"The last of these letters (we quote throughout the words of the same
Editor) is extremely curious. Northumberland commenced by
acknowledging the receipt of a letter from the King, wherein Henry
has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145">(p. 145)</a></span>
expressed his expectation that the Earl would be at
Ormeston Castle on the day appointed, and in sufficient force, without
creating any additional expense to his Majesty; but that, on
consideration, the King, reflecting that this could not be the case
without expenses being incurred by the Earl and his son Hotspur, had
ordered some money to be speedily sent to them. Of that money the Earl
said he knew not the amount, nor the day of payment; that his honour,
as well as the state of the kingdom, was in question; and that the day
on which he was to be at Ormeston was so near, that, if payment was
not soon ordered, it was very probable that the fair renown of the
chivalry of the realm would not be maintained at that place, to the
utter dishonour and grief of him and of his son, who were the King's
loyal subjects; which they believed could not be his wish, nor had
they deserved it. 'If,' the Earl sarcastically observed, 'we had both
been paid the 60,000<i>l.</i> since your coronation, as I have heard you
were informed by those who do not wish to tell you the truth, then we
could better support such a charge; but to this day there is clearly
due to us, as can be fully proved, 20,000<i>l.</i> and more.' He then
entreated the King to order his council and treasurer to pay him and
his son a large sum conformably to the grant made in the last
parliament, and to their indentures, so that no injury might arise to
the realm by the non-payment of what was due to them.' To this letter
he signed himself
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146">(p. 146)</a></span>
'Your Matathias, who supplicates you to
take his state and labour to heart in this affair.'"</p>

<p>There is so much sound reasoning also and good sense in the review of
these proceedings, presented to us by the same pen, that we cannot do
better than adopt it. The Author's subsequent researches have all
tended to confirm that Editor's view:</p>

<p>"This letter preceded the rebellion of the Percies by less than four
weeks; and that event may, it is presumed, be mainly attributed to the
inattention shown to their requests of payment of the large sums which
they had expended in the King's service. They were not only harassed
by debts, and destitute of means to pay their followers, but their
honour, as the Earl expressly told the King, was involved in the
fulfilment of their engagements; a breach of which not only exposed
them to the greatest difficulties, but, in the opinion of their
chivalrous contemporaries, perhaps affected their reputation. That
under these circumstances, and goaded by a sense of injury and
injustice, the fiery Hotspur should throw off his allegiance, and
revolt, is not surprising; but it is matter of astonishment that Henry
should have hazarded such a result. To the house of Percy he was
chiefly indebted for the crown; and it is scarcely credible that at
the moment of their defection it could have been his policy to offend
them. The country was at war with France and Scotland, Wales was then
in open rebellion, and Henry was far from satisfied of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147">(p. 147)</a></span>
the
general loyalty of his subjects. Can it be believed that he desired to
increase his enemies by adding the most powerful family in the kingdom
to the number? Nor can Henry's constant efforts to prevent the people
from becoming disaffected, be reconciled with the wish to excite
discontent in two of the most influential and distinguished personages
in the realm. It is shown in another part of this volume, (Minutes of
Privy Council,) that the King had not the slightest suspicion of
Hotspur's revolt until it took place; and it appears that, when he
heard of it, he was actually on his route to join that chieftain, and,
to use his own words to his council, 'to give aid and support to his
very dear and loyal cousins, the Earl of Northumberland and his son
Henry, in the expedition which they had honourably commenced for him
and his realm against his enemies the Scotch.' Instead of refusing to
pay to the Percies the money which they claimed, from the desire to
lessen their power, or to inflict upon them any species of
mortification, all which is known of the state of this country
justifies the inference that Henry had the strongest motives for
conciliating that family. The neglect of their repeated demands seems,
therefore, to have arisen solely from his being
unable<a id="notetag148" name="notetag148"></a><a href="#note148">[148]</a>
to comply
with them;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148">(p. 148)</a></span>
and the King's pecuniary embarrassments are shown
by the documents in this work to have been of so pressing and so
permanent a nature, that there is no difficulty in believing such to
have been the case. It is deserving of observation, however, that the
discontent which is visible in the letters of Hotspur and his father,
is as much at the conduct of the council as at that of the King; and
jealousy of their superior influence with Henry, and possibly a
suspicion that they endeavoured to injure them in his estimation, as
well as to impede their exertions in his service, by withholding the
necessary resources, may have combined with other causes in producing
their disaffection."<a id="notetag149" name="notetag149"></a><a href="#note149">[149]</a></p>

<p>Not Shakspeare only, in his highly-wrought scene at the Archdeacon of
Bangor's house, but our historians also and their commentators,
instruct us to refer to a point of time very little subsequent to the
date of the last letter from the Earl of Northumberland the celebrated
<span class="smcap">Tripartite Indenture</span> <span class="smcap">of Division</span>.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149">(p. 149)</a></span>
Shakspeare has traced,
with such exquisite designs and shades of colouring, the different
characters of the contracting parties in their acts and sentiments,
and has thrown such vividness and life and beauty into the whole
procedure, that the imagination is led captive, superinducing an
unwillingness to doubt the reality; and the mind reluctantly engages
in an examination of the truth. But, consistently with the principles
adopted in these Memoirs, the Author is compelled to sift the evidence
on which the genuineness of the treaty depends. The document, if it
could have been established as trustworthy, could not have failed to
be interesting to every one as a fact in general history, whilst the
English and Welsh antiquary must in an especial manner have been
gratified by being made acquainted with its particular provisions. At
all events, whatever opinion may be ultimately formed of its character
as the vehicle of historical verity, it is in itself too important,
and has been too widely recognised, to be passed over in these pages
without notice.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Ellis, to whom we are indebted for having first called
attention to the specific stipulations of this alleged treaty, with
his accustomed perspicuity and succinctness thus introduces the
subject to his reader:</p>

<p>"Sir Edmund Mortimer's letter is dated December 13 (1402), and the
Tripartite Indenture of Partition was not fully agreed upon till
toward the middle
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150">(p. 150)</a></span>
of the next year. The negociation for the
partition of the kingdom seems to have originated with Mortimer and
Glyndowr only. The battle of Shrewsbury was fought on July 21st, 1403.
The manuscript chronicle, already named, compiled by one of the
chaplains<a id="notetag150" name="notetag150"></a><a href="#note150">[150]</a>
to King Henry V, gives the particulars of the final
treaty, signed at the house of the Archdeacon of Bangor, more amply
than they can be found elsewhere. The expectation declared in this
treaty that the contracting parties would turn out to be those spoken
of by Merlin, who were to divide amongst them the Greater Britain, as
it is called, corroborates the story told by Hall. The whole passage
is here submitted to the reader's perusal: the words are evidently
those of the treaty." The reader is then furnished with a copy of the
Latin original: but, since no point of the general question as to its
genuineness appears to be affected by the words employed, the
following translation is substituted in its place.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p><span class="smcap">TRIPARTITE INDENTURE OF DIVISION.</span></p>

<p>
     "This year, the Earl of Northumberland made a league and covenant
     and friendship with Owyn Glyndwr and Edmund Mortimer, son of the
     late Edmund Earl of March, in certain articles of the form and
     tenor following:&mdash;In the first place, that these Lords, Owyn, the
     Earl, and Edmund, shall henceforth be mutually joined,
     confederate, united, and bound
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151">(p. 151)</a></span>
     by the bond of a true
     league and true friendship, and sure and good union. Again, that
     every of these Lords shall will and pursue, and also procure, the
     honour and welfare one of another; and shall, in good faith,
     hinder any losses and distresses which shall come to his
     knowledge, by any one whatsoever intended to be inflicted on
     either of them. Every one, also, of them shall act and do with
     another all and every those things which ought to be done by
     good, true, and faithful friends to good, true, and faithful
     friends, laying aside all deceit and fraud. Also, if ever any of
     the said Lords shall know and learn of any loss or damage
     intended against another by any persons whatsoever, he shall
     signify it to the others as speedily as possible, and assist them
     in that particular, that each may take such measures as may seem
     good against such malicious purposes; and they shall be anxious
     to prevent such injuries in good faith; also, they shall assist
     each other to the utmost of their power in the time of necessity.
     Also, if by God's appointment it should appear to the said Lords
     in process of time that they are the same persons of whom the
     Prophet speaks, between whom the government of the Greater
     Britain ought to be divided and parted, then they and every of
     them shall labour to their utmost to bring this effectually to be
     accomplished. Each of them, also, shall be content with that
     portion of the kingdom aforesaid limited as below, without
     further exaction or superiority; yea, each of them in such
     portion assigned to him shall enjoy equal liberty. Also, between
     the same Lords it is unanimously covenanted and agreed that the
     said Owyn and his heirs shall have the whole of Cambria or Wales,
     by the borders, limits, and boundaries underwritten divided from
     Leogoed which is commonly called England; namely, from the Severn
     sea, as the river Severn leads from the sea, going down to the
     north gate of the city of Worcester; and from that gate straight
     to the ash-trees, commonly called in the Cambrian or Welsh
     language Ouuene Margion, which grow on the high
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152">(p. 152)</a></span>
     way
     from Bridgenorth to Kynvar; thence by the high way direct, which
     is usually called the old or ancient way to the head or source of
     the river Trent; thence to the head or source of the river Meuse;
     thence as that river leads to the sea, going down within the
     borders, limits, and boundaries above written. And the aforesaid
     Earl of Northumberland shall have for himself and his heirs the
     counties below written, namely, Northumberland, Westmoreland,
     Lancashire, York, Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Stafford,
     Leicester, Northampton, Warwick, and Norfolk. And the Lord Edmund
     shall have all the rest of the whole of England entirely to him
     and his heirs. Also, should any battle, riot, or discord fall out
     between two of the said Lords, (may it never be!) then the third
     of the said Lords, calling to himself good and faithful counsel,
     shall duly rectify such discord, riot, and battle; whose approval
     or sentence the discordant parties shall be held bound to obey.
     They shall also be faithful to defend the kingdom against all
     men; saving the oak on the part of the said Owyn given to the
     most illustrious Prince Charles, by the grace of God King of the
     French, in the league and covenant between them made. And that
     the same be, all and singular, well and faithfully observed, the
     said Lords, Owyn, the Earl, and Edmund, by the holy body of the
     Lord which they now stedfastly look upon, and by the holy Gospels
     of God by them now bodily touched, have sworn to observe the
     premises all and singular to their utmost, inviolably; and have
     caused their seals to be mutually affixed thereto."</p></div>


<p>The above learned Editor of this instrument (to whose labours in
rescuing from oblivion so many original documents relative to these
times we are repeatedly induced to acknowledge our obligations,) seems
to have fallen into some serious mistakes here. Either influenced by
the fascinating reminiscences
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153">(p. 153)</a></span>
of Shakspeare's representations,
or following Hall with too implicit a confidence, he has altogether
overlooked the date assigned in the manuscript itself to the execution
of this partition deed, and the persons between whom the agreement is
there said to have been made. So far from countenancing the assumption
that "the indenture was finally agreed upon towards the middle of the
year next after the date of Edmund Mortimer's letter announcing his
junction with Owyn (December 14th, 1402)," the manuscript expressly
states that the covenant was made on the 28th of
February,<a id="notetag151" name="notetag151"></a><a href="#note151">[151]</a>
in the
fourth year of Henry IV; and that the contracting parties were Henry
Earl of Northumberland, Sir Edmund Mortimer, and Owyn Glyndowr. Hall,
on whom there exists strong reason for believing that Shakspeare
rested as his authority, asserts that the contracting parties were
Glyndowr, the <span class="smcap">Lord Percy</span> (by which title he throughout designates
Hotspur), and the <span class="smcap">Earl of March</span>. Hall's expressions would lead us to
infer that the circumstance was not generally recognised or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154">(p. 154)</a></span>
known by the chroniclers before his time, but was recorded by one only
of those with whose writings he was acquainted. "A certain writer," he
says, "writeth that this Earl of March, the Lord Percy, and Owyn
Glyndowr were unwisely made believe by a Welsh prophesier that King
Henry was the Moldwarp cursed of God's own mouth, and that they were
the Dragon, the Lion, and the Wolf which should divide the realm
between them, by the deviation, not divination, of that mawmet
Merlin." Hall then proceeds to tell us that the tripartite indenture
was sealed by the deputies of the three parties in the Archdeacon's
house; and that, by the treaty, Wales was given to Owyn, all England
from Severn and Trent southward and eastward, was assigned to the Earl
of March, and the remnant to Lord Percy.</p>

<p>The strange confusion made either by Hall, or "the certain writer"
from whom he draws his story, of Owyn's prisoner and son-in-law,
Edmund Mortimer, with the Earl of March his nephew, then a minor in
the King's safe custody, throws doubtless great suspicion on his
narrative; nevertheless, such as it is, (allowing for that mistake,)
his account seems far more probable than the statement given in the
Sloane manuscript,&mdash;the only authority, it is presumed, now known to
have reported the alleged words of the treaty. It is much more likely,
that the project of dividing South Britain among the houses of
Glyndowr, Mortimer,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155">(p. 155)</a></span>
and Percy, should have been entertained
before the battle of Shrewsbury, when the Earl of Worcester's
malicious love of mischief might have suggested it, and Hotspur's
headstrong impetuosity might have caught at the scheme, and their
troops, not yet dispirited by defeat, might have been sanguine of
success, than after that struggle, when the old Earl of
Northumberland<a id="notetag152" name="notetag152"></a><a href="#note152">[152]</a>
was the only representative of the house of Percy
who could have signed it. The cause of Owyn, Mortimer, and
Northumberland had so sunk into its wane after Hotspur's death, that
they could then scarcely have contemplated as a thing feasible the
division of the fair realm of England and Wales among themselves. Of
the authority of the manuscript from which the indenture is extracted,
the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156">(p. 156)</a></span>
Author (for reasons stated in the Appendix) is compelled
to form a very low estimate. And if such a deed ever was signed, it is
far less improbable that the manuscript (full, as it confessedly is
elsewhere, of errors) should have inserted it incorrectly in point of
chronological order, than that the contracting parties should have
postponed their contemplated arrangement to a period when success must
have appeared almost beyond hope. Independently, however, of the
suspicion cast on the document by the date assigned to it in the
manuscript, it seems to carry with it internal evidence against
itself. The contract was made by Edmund Mortimer, the Earl of
Northumberland, and Owyn, and among them the land was to be divided;
but, so far from the report of such an intended distribution being
corroborated by any other authority, there is much evidence to render
it incredible. Edmund Mortimer's own genuine letter, for example,
announcing his adhesion to Owyn, which preceded this agreement, makes
no allusion to the Percies, or even to himself, as portionists. "The
cause," he says, "which he espoused would guarantee to Owyn his rights
in Wales, and, in case Richard were dead, would place the Earl of
March on the throne." It is, indeed, scarcely conceivable that the
nobles, the gentry, and the people at large would have suffered their
land to be cut up into portions, destroying the integrity of the
kingdom, and exposing it with increased facilities to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157">(p. 157)</a></span>
foreign invasion, and interminable intestine warfare; whilst neither
of the three who were to share the spoil had any pretensions of title
to the crown. It is scarcely less inconceivable that three men, such
as Mortimer, Glyndowr, and Northumberland, could have seriously
devised so desperate a scheme.</p>

<p>On the whole, the Author is disposed to express his suspicion that the
entire story of the tripartite league is the creature only of
invention, originating in some inexplicable mistake, or fabricated for
the purpose of exciting feelings of contempt or hostility against the
rebels.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>In examining the various accounts of the battle of Shrewsbury with a
view of putting together ascertained facts in right order, and
distinguishing between certainty,&mdash;strong probability,&mdash;mere
surmise,&mdash;improbabilities,&mdash;and utter mistakes, we shall find it far
more easy to point out the errors of others, than to adopt one general
view which shall not in its turn be open to objections. Still, in any
important course of events, it seems to be a dereliction of duty in an
author to shrink from offering the most probable outline of facts
which the careful comparison of different statements, and a patient
weighing of opposite authorities, suggest. Before, however, we enter
upon that task, it will be necessary to clear the way by examining
some other questions of doubt and difficulty.</p>

<p>To
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158">(p. 158)</a></span>
Mr. Hume's inaccuracies, arising from the want of patient
labour in searching for truth at the fountain-head, we have been led
to refer above. His readiness to rest satisfied with whatever first
offered itself, provided it suited his present purpose, without either
scrutinizing its internal evidence, or verifying it by reference to
earlier and better authority, is forced upon our notice in his account
of the battle of Shrewsbury. Just one half of the entire space which
he spares to record the whole affair, he devotes to a minute detail of
the manifesto which Hotspur is said to have sent to the King on the
night before the battle, in the name of his father, his uncle, and
himself. This document, at least in the terms quoted by Mr. Hume, is
proved as well by its own internal self-contradictions, as by
historical facts, to be a forgery of a much later date.</p>

<p>The first charge which the manifesto is made to bring against Henry
is, that, after his landing at Ravenspurg, he swore on the Gospel that
he only sought his own rightful inheritance, that he would never
disturb Richard in his possession of the throne, and that never would
he aim at being King. And yet another item charges him with having
sworn on the same day, and at the same place, and on the same Gospel,
an oath (the very terms of which imply that he was to be King) that he
never would exact tenths or fifteenths without consent of the three
estates, except in cases of extreme emergence. Again, "It complained
of his cruel policy (says Mr. Hume, without adding a single remark,)
in allowing the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159">(p. 159)</a></span>
young Earl of March, whom he ought to regard
as his sovereign, to remain a captive in the hands of his enemies, and
in even refusing to all his friends permission to treat of his
ransom;" whilst it is beyond all question that the person whom this
pretended manifesto confounds with the Earl of March, "taken in
pitched battle," was Sir Edmund Mortimer. The Earl of March was
himself then a boy, and was in close custody in Henry's castle of
Windsor. The manifesto, as Hume quotes it, is evidently full of
historical blunders; its author had followed those historians who had
confounded Edmund Mortimer with the Earl of March; and yet Mr. Hume
adopts it on the authority of Hall, and gives it so prominent a place
in his work.</p>

<p>But even as the manifesto is found in its original form in Hardyng,
(though the blunders copied by Hume from
Hall<a id="notetag153" name="notetag153"></a><a href="#note153">[153]</a>
do not appear there
in all their extravagance and absurdity,) something attaches to it
exceedingly suspicious as to its character and circumstances.
Independently of the internal evidence of the document itself, which
will repay a careful scrutiny, the very fact of Hardyng having
withheld even the most distant allusion to such a manifesto in the
copy of his work which he presented to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160">(p. 160)</a></span>
Henry VI, the grandson
of the King whose character the manifesto was designed to blast, at a
time so much nearer the event, when the reality or the falsehood of
his statement might have been more easily ascertained, contrasts very
strikingly with the forced and unnatural manner in which, many years
after, he abruptly thrusts the manifesto in Latin prose into the midst
of his English poem. He
then<a id="notetag154" name="notetag154"></a><a href="#note154">[154]</a>
desired to please Edward IV, to whom
any adverse reflection on Bolinbroke would be acceptable.</p>

<p>The document, however, itself savours strongly of forgery. In the
first place, it purports to be signed and sealed by Henry Percy, Earl
of Northumberland, (though the Earl at that time was in
Northumberland,) Henry Percy, his first-born son, and Thomas Earl of
Worcester, styling themselves Procurators and Protectors of the
kingdom. Should this apparent contradiction be thought to be
reconciled with the truth by what Hardyng mentions, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161">(p. 161)</a></span>
the
document was made by good advice of the Archbishop of York, and divers
other holy men and lords; it must be answered that it could not have
been drawn up for the purpose of being used whenever an opportunity
might offer, for, in the name of the three, it challenges the King,
and declares that they will prove the allegations "<i>on this day</i>,"
"<i>on this instant day</i>," twice repeated. Evidently the writer of the
document had his mind upon the fatal day of Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>Again, one of their principal charges seems to have emanated from a
person totally ignorant of some facts which must have been known to
the Percies, and which are established by documents still in our
hands. The words of the clause to which we refer run thus: "We aver
and intend to prove, that whereas Edmund Mortimer, brother of the Earl
of March, was taken by Owyn Glyndowr in mortal battle, in the open
field, and has <span class="smcap">UP TO THIS
TIME</span><a id="notetag155" name="notetag155"></a><a href="#note155">[155]</a>
<i>been cruelly kept in prison</i> and
bands of iron, in your cause, you have publicly declared him to have
been guilefully taken, [ex dolo,&mdash;willingly, as Hall quotes it, to
yield himself prisoner to the said Owyn,] and you would not suffer him
to be ransomed, neither by his own means nor by us his relatives and
friends. We have, therefore, negociated with Owyn, as well for his
ransom from our own proper goods, as also for peace between you and
Owyn. Wherefore have you regarded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162">(p. 162)</a></span>
us as traitors, and
moreover have craftily and secretly planned and imagined our death and
utter destruction."</p>

<p>This clause of the manifesto declares the King to have publicly
proclaimed that Edmund Mortimer, who was taken in pitched battle, had
fraudulently given himself up to Owyn. The King's own letter to the
council<a id="notetag156" name="notetag156"></a><a href="#note156">[156]</a>
is totally irreconcileable with his making such a
declaration. He announces to them the news which he had just received
of Mortimer's capture, as a calamity which had made him resolve to
proceed in person against the rebels. "Tidings have reached us from
Wales, that the rebels have taken our very dear and much beloved
Edmund Mortimer." Again, the clause avers that the King had suffered
the same person, Edmund Mortimer, to be kept cruelly in prison and
iron chains <i>up to that time</i>, and would not suffer him to be
ransomed. In contradiction to this charge, we are assured by the early
chroniclers<a id="notetag157" name="notetag157"></a><a href="#note157">[157]</a>
that Owyn treated Mortimer with all the humanity and
respect in his power; and that because he possessed not the means of
paying a ransom, he had, as early as St. Andrew's day, (30th of
November 1402, less than six months after his capture, and nearly
eight months before the alleged delivery of the manifesto,) been
married to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163">(p. 163)</a></span>
daughter of Owyn with great solemnity; and,
"thus turning wholly to the Welsh people, he pledged himself
thereafter to fight for them to the utmost of his power against the
English."</p>

<p>Another expression in this clause, incompatible with the truth, but
quite consistent with the mistakes which from very early times
prevailed as to the circumstances preceding the battle of Shrewsbury,
charges the King with having pronounced the three Percies to be
traitors, and with having secretly planned and imagined their ruin and
death; and this is said to have been signed and sealed by
Northumberland, then remaining in the north. Whereas the truth,
established beyond controversy, though little known, is, that, up to
the very day when the King announced to the council Hotspur's
rebellion,&mdash;barely four days before the battle,&mdash;he had entertained no
idea of their disloyalty. Even in his last preceding despatch he
informed the council that he was on his way "to afford aid and comfort
to his very dear and faithful cousins, the Earl of Northumberland and
his son Henry, and to join them in their expedition against the
Scots."<a id="notetag158" name="notetag158"></a><a href="#note158">[158]</a></p>

<p>These considerations, among others, throw so many and such weighty
suspicions on the manifesto, that it can scarcely be regarded as
deserving of credit. Nor must the Author here disguise his conviction,
that the whole is a forgery, guiltily made for the purpose of
blackening the memory of Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164">(p. 164)</a></span>
IV, and of casting odium on
the dynasty of the house of Lancaster.</p>

<p>Another important mistake into which tradition seems to have betrayed
some very pains-taking persons is that which charges Owyn Glyndowr
with a breach of faith, and a selfish conduct, on the occasion of the
battle of Shrewsbury, utterly unworthy of any man of the slightest
pretensions to integrity and honour. He is said by Leland to have
promised Percy to be present at that struggle: he is reported by
Pennant to have remained, as if spell-bound, with twelve thousand men
at Oswestry. The History of Shrewsbury tells us of the still existing
remains of an oak at Shelton, into the top-most branches of which he
climbed to see the turn of the battle, resolving to proceed or retire
as that should be; having come with his forces to that spot time
enough to join the conflict. The question involving Owyn Glyndowr's
good faith and valour, or zeal and activity, is one of much interest,
and deserves to be patiently investigated; whilst an attentive
examination of authentic documents, and a careful comparison of dates,
are essential to the establishment of the truth. The result of the
inquiry may be new, and yet not on that account the less to be relied
upon.</p>

<p>That Owyn gladly promised to co-operate with the Percies, there is
every reason to regard as time; that he undertook to be with them at
Shrewsbury on that day of battle cannot, it should seem, be true.
Probably he never heard of any expectation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165">(p. 165)</a></span>
of such an
engagement, and the first news which reached him relating to it may
have been tidings of Percy's death, and the discomfiture of his
troops. The Welsh historians unsparingly charge him with having
deceived his northern friends on that day: and some assert that he
remained at Oswestry, only seventeen miles off; others that he came to
the very banks of the Severn, and tarried there in safety, consulting
only his own interest, whilst a vigorous effort on his part might have
turned the victory that day against the King. This is, perhaps, within
the verge of possibility; but is in the highest degree improbable.
That the reports have originated in an entire ignorance of Owyn's
probable position at the time, and of the sudden, unforeseen, and
unexpected character of the struggle to which Bolinbroke's
instantaneous decision forced the Percies, will evidently appear, if,
instead of relying on vague tradition, we follow in search of the
reality where facts only, or fair inferences from ascertained facts,
may conduct us.</p>

<p>It appears, then, to be satisfactorily demonstrable by original
documents, interpreted independently of preconceived theory, that,
four days only before King Henry's proclamation against the Percies
was issued at Burton upon Trent, Owyn Glyndowr was in the extreme
divisions of Caermarthenshire, most actively and anxiously engaged in
reducing the English castles which still held out against him, and by
no means free from formidable antagonists
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166">(p. 166)</a></span>
in the field,
being fully occupied at that juncture, and likely to be detained there
for some time. It must be also remembered that the King published his
proclamation as soon as ever he had himself heard of Hotspur's
movements from the north, and that even his knowledge of the hostile
intentions of the Percies preceded the very battle itself only by the
brief space of five days. This circumstance has never (it is presumed)
been noticed by any of our historians; and the examination of the
whole question involves so new and important a view of the affairs of
the Principality at that period, and bears so immediately on the
charge made against the great rebel chieftain for dastardly cowardice
or gross breach of faith, that it seems to claim in these volumes a
fuller and more minute investigation than might otherwise have been
desirable or generally interesting. The documents furnishing the facts
on which we ground our opinion, are chiefly original letters preserved
in the British Museum, and made accessible to the general reader by
having been published by Sir Henry
Ellis.<a id="notetag159" name="notetag159"></a><a href="#note159">[159]</a>
That excellent Editor,
however, has unquestionably referred them to an earlier date than can
be truly assigned to
them.<a id="notetag160" name="notetag160"></a><a href="#note160">[160]</a>
Independently of the material fact
which they are intended to establish, they carry with them much
intrinsic interest of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167">(p. 167)</a></span>
their own; and although the detail of
the evidence in the body of the work might seem to impede
unnecessarily the progress of the narrative, the dissertation in its
detached form is recommended to the reader's careful perusal. Should
he close his examination of those documents under the same impression
which the Author confesses they have made on himself, he will
acquiesce in the conclusion above stated, and consider this position
as admitting no reasonable doubt,&mdash;That, a few days only before the
fatal battle of Shrewsbury, Owyn Glyndowr was in the very extremity of
South Wales, engaged in attempts to reduce the enemy's garrisons, and
crush his power in those quarters; with a prospect also before him of
much similar employment in a service of great danger to himself. And
when we recollect that probably Henry Percy as little expected the
King to meet him at Shrewsbury, as the King a week before had thought
to find him or his father in any other part of the kingdom than in
Northumberland, whither he was himself on his march to join them; when
we recollect the nature and extent of the country which lies between
Pembrokeshire and Salop; and reflect also on the undisciplined state
of Owyn's "eight thousand and eight score spears, such as they were;"
instead of being surprised at his absence from Shrewsbury on the 21st
of July, and charging him with having deserted his friends and sworn
allies on that sad field, we are driven to believe that his presence
there would have savoured
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168">(p. 168)</a></span>
more of the marvellous than many
of his most celebrated achievements. The simple truth breaks the spell
of the poet's picture, and forces us to unveil its fallacy, though it
has been pronounced by the historian of Shrewsbury to "form one of the
brightest ornaments of the pages of Marmion." To whatever cause we
ascribe the decline of Owyn's power, we cannot trace its origin to a
judicial visitation as the consequence of his failure in that hour of
need. The poet's imagination, creative of poetical justice, wrought
upon the tale as it was told; but that tale was not built on truth.
The lines, however, deserve to have been the vehicle of a less
ill-founded tradition.</p>

<p class="poem">

By wizard's dream or potent spell,<br>

<p>Those who feel an interest in tracing the localities of this battle
with a greater minuteness of detail in its circumstances than is
requisite for the purpose of these Memoirs, will do well to consult
the "Historian of Shrewsbury." The following is offered as the
probable outline of the circumstances of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169">(p. 169)</a></span>
the engagement,
together with those which preceded and followed it.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>The Earl of Northumberland and his son Hotspur were engaged in
collecting and organizing troops in the north, for the professed
purpose of invading Scotland as soon as the King should join them with
his forces. Taking from these troops "eight score horse,"
Hotspur<a id="notetag162" name="notetag162"></a><a href="#note162">[162]</a>
marched southward from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170">(p. 170)</a></span>
Berwick at their head, and came
through Lancashire and Cheshire, spreading his rebellious principles
on every side, and adding to his army, especially from among the
gentry. He proclaimed everywhere that their favourite Richard, though
deposed by the tyranny of Bolinbroke, was still alive; and many
gathered round his standard, resolved to avenge the wrongs of their
liege lord. The King, with a considerable force, the amount of which
is not precisely known, was on his march towards the north, with the
intention of joining the forces raised by the Percies, and of
advancing with them into Scotland, and, "that expedition well ended,"
of returning to quell the rebels in Wales. He was at Burton on Trent
when news was brought to him of Hotspur's proceedings, which decided
him<a id="notetag163" name="notetag163"></a><a href="#note163">[163]</a>
instantly to grapple with this unlooked-for rebellion.
Hotspur was believed to be on his road to join Glyndowr, and the King
resolved to intercept him.</p>

<p>So far from inferring, as some authors have done, from the smallness
of the numbers on either side, that the country considered it more a
personal quarrel between two great families than as a national
concern, we might rather feel surprise at the magnitude
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171">(p. 171)</a></span>
of
the body of men which met in the field of
Shrewsbury.<a id="notetag164" name="notetag164"></a><a href="#note164">[164]</a>
It must be
remembered that the King did not "go down" from the seat of government
with 14,000 men; but that the army with which he hastened to crush the
rising rebellion consisted only of the troops at the head of whom he
was marching towards the north, of the body then under the Prince of
Wales on the borders, and of those who could be gathered together on
the exigence of the moment by the royal proclamation. It must be borne
also in mind that (according to all probability) barely four days
elapsed between the first intimation which reached the King's ears of
the rebellion of the Percies, and the desperate conflict which crushed
them. As we have already seen, the King, only on the 10th of July,
(scarcely eleven days before that decisive struggle,) believed himself
to be on his road northward to join "his beloved and loyal"
Northumberland and Hotspur against the Scots.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales, who, as we infer, first apprised the King of this
rising peril, was on the Welsh borders, near Shrewsbury; and he formed
a junction with his father,&mdash;but where, and on what day, is not known.
Very probably the first intimation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172">(p. 172)</a></span>
that Henry of Monmouth
himself had of the hostile designs of the Percies, was the sudden
departure of the Earl of Worcester, his guardian, who unexpectedly
left the Prince's retinue, and, taking his own dependents with him,
joined Hotspur.</p>

<p>At all events, delay would have added every hour to the imminent peril
of the royal cause, and probably Hotspur's impetuosity seconded the
King's manifest policy of hastening an immediate engagement; and thus
the "sorry battle of Shrewsbury" was fought by the united forces of
the King and the Prince on the one side, and the forces of Hotspur and
his uncle the Earl of Worcester on the other, unassisted by Glyndowr.</p>

<p>That the opposed parties engaged in "Heyteley
Field,"<a id="notetag165" name="notetag165"></a><a href="#note165">[165]</a>
near that
town, is placed beyond question. With regard to their relative
position immediately before the battle, there is no inconsiderable
doubt. Some say that the King's army reached the town and took
possession of the castle on the Friday, only three hours before
Hotspur arrived: others, following
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173">(p. 173)</a></span>
Walsingham, represent
Hotspur as having arrived first, and being in the very act of
assaulting the town, when the sudden, unexpected appearance of the
royal banner advancing made him desist from that attempt, and face the
King's forces. Be this as it may, on Saturday the 21st of July, the
two hostile armies were drawn up in array against each other in
Hateley Field, ready to rush to the struggle on which the fate of
England was destined much to depend. Whether any manifesto were sent
from Hotspur, or not, it is certain that the King made an effort to
prevent the desperate conflict, and the unnecessary shedding of so
much Christian blood. He despatched the Abbot of Shrewsbury and the
Clerk of the Privy Seal to Hotspur's lines, with offers of pardon even
then, would they return to their allegiance. Hotspur was much moved by
this act of grace, and sent his uncle, the Earl of Worcester, to
negociate. This man has been called the origin of all the mischief;
and he is said so to have addressed the King, and so to have
misinterpreted his mild and considerate conversation, "who
condescended, in his desire of reconciliation, even below the royal
dignity," that both parties were incensed the more, and resolved
instantly to try their strength. The onset was made by the archers of
Hotspur, whose tremendous volleys caused dreadful carnage among the
King's troops. "They fell," says Walsingham, "as the leaves fall on
the ground after a frosty night at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174">(p. 174)</a></span>
the approach of winter.
There was no room for the arrows to reach the ground, every one struck
a mortal man." The King's bowmen also did their duty. A rumour,
spreading through the host, that the King had fallen, shook the
steadiness and confidence of his partisans, and many took to flight;
the royal presence, however, in every part of the engagement soon
rallied his men. Hotspur and Douglas seemed anxious to fight neither
with small nor great, but with the King
only;<a id="notetag166" name="notetag166"></a><a href="#note166">[166]</a>
though they mowed
down his ranks, making alleys, as in a field of corn, in their
eagerness to reach him. He was, we are told, unhorsed again and again;
but returned to the charge with increased impetuosity. His
standard-bearer was killed at his side, and the standard thrown down.
At length the Earl of Dunbar forced him away from the post which he
had taken. Henry of Monmouth, though he was then no novice in martial
deeds, yet had never before been engaged on any pitched-battle field;
and here he did his duty valiantly. He was wounded in the face by an
arrow; but, so far from allowing himself to be removed on that account
to a place of safety, he urged his friends to lead him into the very
hottest of the conflict. Elmham records his address: whether they are
the very words
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175">(p. 175)</a></span>
he uttered, or such only as he was likely to
have used, they certainly suit his character: "My lords, far be from
me such disgrace, as that, like a poltroon, I should stain my
noviciate in arms by flight. If the Prince flies, who will wait to end
the battle? Believe it, to be carried back before victory would be to
me a perpetual death! Lead me, I implore you, to the very face of the
foe. I may not say to my friends, 'Go ye on first to the fight.' Be it
mine to say, 'Follow me, my friends.'" The next time we hear of Henry
of Monmouth is as an agent of mercy. The personal conflict between him
and Hotspur, into the description of which Shakspeare has infused so
full a share of his powers of song, has no more substantial origin
than the poet's own imagination. Percy fell by an unknown hand, and
his death decided the contest. The cry, "Henry Percy is dead!" which
the royalists raised, was the signal for utter confusion and
flight.<a id="notetag167" name="notetag167"></a><a href="#note167">[167]</a>
The number of the slain on either side is differently
reported. When the two armies met, the King's was superior in numbers,
but Hotspur's far more abounded in gentle blood. The greater part of
the gentlemen of Cheshire fell on that day. On the King's
part,<a id="notetag168" name="notetag168"></a><a href="#note168">[168]</a>
except the Earl
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176">(p. 176)</a></span>
of Stafford and Sir Walter Blount, few names
of note are reckoned among the slain.</p>

<p>The Earl of Worcester, Lord Douglas, and Sir Richard Vernon, fell into
the hands of the King; they were kept prisoners till the next Monday,
when Worcester and Vernon were beheaded. The Earl's head was sent up
to London on the 25th (the following Wednesday), by the bearer of the
royal mandate, commanding it to be placed upon London bridge.</p>

<p>Thus ended the "sad and sorry field of
Shrewsbury."<a id="notetag169" name="notetag169"></a><a href="#note169">[169]</a>
The battle
appeared to be the archetype of that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177">(p. 177)</a></span>
cruel conflict which in
the middle of the century almost annihilated the ancient nobility of
England. Fabyan says, "it was more to be noted vengeable, for there
the father was slain of the son, and the son of the father."</p>

<p>No sooner had the King gained the field of Shrewsbury than he took the
most prompt measures to extinguish what remained of the rebellion of
the Percies. On the very next day he issued a commission to the Earl
of Westmoreland, William Gascoigne, and others, for levying forces to
act against the Earl of Northumberland. That nobleman, as we have
seen, remained in the north, probably in consequence of a sudden
attack of illness, when Hotspur made his ill-fated descent into the
south: but the King had good reason to believe that he was still in
arms against the crown; and although he despatched that commission of
array to the Earl of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179">(p. 179)</a></span>
Westmoreland within only a few hours of
the battle, yet he resolved to march forthwith in
person,<a id="notetag170" name="notetag170"></a><a href="#note170">[170]</a>
and
crush the rebellion by one decisive blow. On Monday the 23rd, the Earl
of Worcester was beheaded; and on the same day all his silver vessels,
forfeited to the King, were given to the
Prince.<a id="notetag171" name="notetag171"></a><a href="#note171">[171]</a>
On the Tuesday
the King must have started for the north; for we find two ordinances
dated at Stafford, a distance of thirty miles from Shrewsbury, on
Wednesday the 25th. Whilst one of these royal mandates savours of
severity, the other not only is the message of mercy and forgiveness,
but recommends itself to us from the consideration of the person to
whom the exercise of the royal clemency was intrusted with unlimited
discretion. Henry of Monmouth, perhaps, left Shrewsbury after the
battle, and proceeded with his father on his journey northward; but we
conclude Stafford to have been, at all events, the furthest point from
the Principality to which he accompanied him. Whether the measure of
mercy originated with the King or the Prince, certainly both the King
believed that his son would gladly execute the commission, and the
Prince felt happy in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180">(p. 180)</a></span>
being made the royal representative in
the exercise of a monarch's best and holiest prerogative. An ordinance
was made by the King at Stafford, investing the Prince of Wales with
full powers to pardon the rebels who were in the company of Henry
Percy. The Prince probably remained in or near Shrewsbury for the
discharge of the duties assigned to him by this commission. The King,
having despatched messengers throughout the whole realm announcing
Henry Percy's death and the defeat of the rebels, and commanding all
ports to be watched that none of the vanquished might escape,
proceeded northward. On the 4th of August we find him at Pontefract,
from which place he issued an order to the
Sheriff<a id="notetag172" name="notetag172"></a><a href="#note172">[172]</a>
of York, which
certainly indicates anything rather than a thirst of vengeance on his
enemies. It appears that many persons, reckless of justice and
confident of impunity, had laid violent hands on the goods of the
rebels; and different families had thus been subjected to most
grievous spoliation. The King's ordinance conveys a peremptory order
to the Sheriff of Yorkshire to interpose his authority, and prevent
such acts of violence and wrong, even upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181">(p. 181)</a></span>
the King's
enemies. On the 6th, we find him still at Pontefract, and again on the
14th. Official documents, without supplying any matter which needs
detain us here, account for him through the intervening days.
Walsingham also relates that the King proceeded to York, and summoned
the whole county of Northumberland to appear before him. The Earl, who
had started with a strong body a few days after the battle, either in
ignorance of his son's failure, or to meet the King for the purpose of
treating with him for peace, had been resisted by the Earl of
Westmoreland, and compelled to retire to Warkworth. On receiving the
King's summons, leaving the commonalty behind, he approached the royal
presence with a small retinue, and, in the humble guise of a
suppliant, besought
forgiveness.<a id="notetag173" name="notetag173"></a><a href="#note173">[173]</a>
The King granted him full
pardon, on the 11th of
August;<a id="notetag174" name="notetag174"></a><a href="#note174">[174]</a>
and then began his return towards
Wales. We find him, from the 14th to the
16th,<a id="notetag175" name="notetag175"></a><a href="#note175">[175]</a>
at Pontefract; on
the 17th, at Doncaster. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182">(p. 182)</a></span>
18th, at Worksop; on the 26th,
at Woodstock; and on the 8th of September, at
Worcester.<a id="notetag176" name="notetag176"></a><a href="#note176">[176]</a></p>

<p>After these acts of grace and pardon to Lord Douglas, Northumberland,
and all others who were joined to Sir Henry Percy, we should not
expect to find a charge substantiated of wanton and brutal cruelty and
vengeance on the part of the King against the corpse of that gallant
knight. Such a charge, however, is brought in the most severe terms
which language can supply in the manifesto said to have been made by
the Archbishop of York. The fact of Hotspur's exhumation may be
granted, and yet the King's memory may remain free from such a
charge.<a id="notetag177" name="notetag177"></a><a href="#note177">[177]</a>
That the body was buried, and afterwards disinterred and
exposed to public view, seems not to admit of a doubt. As it appears
from the Chronicle of London, "Persons reported that Percy was yet
alive. He was therefore taken up out of the grave, and bound upright
between two mill-stones, that all men might see that he was dead."
"The cause of Hotspur's exhumation is therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183">(p. 183)</a></span>
satisfactorily explained; and, since it must have been very desirable
to remove all doubt as to the fact of his death, the charge of
needless barbarity which has been brought against the King for
disinterring him is without
foundation."<a id="notetag178" name="notetag178"></a><a href="#note178">[178]</a></p>

<p>The King now adopted prompt and vigorous measures for the suppression
of the rebellion in Wales; and with that view issued from Worcester an
ordinance to several persons by name, to keep their castles in good
repair, well provided also with men and arms. Among others, the Bishop
of St. David's is strictly charged as to his castle of Laghadyn;
Nevill de Furnivale, for Goodrich; Edward Charleton of Powis, for
Caerleon and Usk; John Chandos, for Snowdon. On the 10th of September,
the King, still at Worcester, created his son, John of Lancaster,
Constable of England. On the 14th he was at
Hereford,<a id="notetag179" name="notetag179"></a><a href="#note179">[179]</a>
when he
gave a warrant to William Beauchamp, (to whom was intrusted the care
of Abergavenny and Ewias Harold,) to receive into their allegiance the
Welsh rebels of those lordships. A similar warrant for the rebels of
Brecknock, Builth, Haye, with others, is given, on the 15th, to Sir
John Oldcastle, John ap Herry, and John Fairford, clerk, dated
Devennock. The King was then on his route towards
Caermarthen,<a id="notetag180" name="notetag180"></a><a href="#note180">[180]</a>
where he stayed only a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184">(p. 184)</a></span>
short time; and left the Earl of
Somerset, Sir Thomas Beaufort, the Bishop of Bath, and Lord Grey to
keep the castle and town for one month. He shortly afterwards
commissioned Prince Henry to negociate with those persons for their
pardon who had been excepted from the act of oblivion after the battle
of Shrewsbury.<a id="notetag181" name="notetag181"></a><a
href="#note181">[181]</a></p>

<p>The Welsh, though driven probably from
Caermarthenshire<a id="notetag182" name="notetag182"></a><a
href="#note182">[182]</a> in the
early part of this autumn, seem to have carried on their hostilities
in other districts with much vigour into the very middle of
winter.<a id="notetag183" name="notetag183"></a><a href="#note183">[183]</a>
On
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185">(p. 185)</a></span>
the 8th of November, the King, being then at
Cirencester, issued strict orders for the payment of 100<i>l.</i> to Lord
Berkeley, for the succour of the garrison of Llanpadarn Castle, then
straitly besieged by the rebels, and in great danger of falling into
their hands. Lord Berkeley was appointed Admiral of the Fleet to the
westward of the Thames, on the 5th of November 1403.</p>

<p>On the 22d of November the King issued a proclamation for all rebels
to apply for an amnesty before the Feast of the Epiphany next ensuing,
or in default thereof to expect nothing but the strict course of the
law.</p>

<p>It is matter of doubt whether Prince Henry remained in Wales and the
borders through the winter, or returned to his charge in the spring.
On the opening of the campaign, however, in 1404, we find the Welsh
chieftain aided by a power which must have made his rebellion far more
formidable than it had hitherto been. A truce between England and
France had been concluded just before the battle of Shrewsbury, but it
was of very short duration. Early in the spring, the French appeared
off the shores of Wales in armed vessels, and in conjunction with
Glyndowr's forces, laid siege to several castles along the coast. As
early as April 23rd, a sum of 300<i>l.</i> is assigned by the council for
equipping with men and arms, provisions and stores, five
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186">(p. 186)</a></span>
vessels in the port of Bristol, to relieve the castles of Aberystwith
and Cardigan, and to compel the French to raise the siege of
Caernarvon and Harlech.<a id="notetag184" name="notetag184"></a><a
href="#note184">[184]</a> Not only were the castles on the coast
brought into increased jeopardy by this accession of a continental
force to Owyn's army of native rebels, but the inhabitants of the
interior, already miserably plundered, and in numberless cases utterly
ruined, by the ravages of the Welsh, now began to give themselves up
to despair. A letter from the King's loyal subjects of Shropshire
(which we must refer to this spring), praying for immediate succour
against the confederate forces of Wales and France, furnishes a most
deplorable view of the state of those districts. One-third part of
that county, they say, had been already destroyed, whilst the
inhabitants were compelled to leave their homes, in order to obtain
their living in other more favoured parts of the realm. The petition
prays for the protection of men-at-arms and archers, till the
Prince<a id="notetag185" name="notetag185"></a><a href="#note185">[185]</a>
himself should come.</p>

<p>Soon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187">(p. 187)</a></span>
after the French had carried on these hostile movements,
their King made a solemn league with Owyn Glyndowr, as an independent
sovereign, acknowledging him to be Prince of Wales. Owyn dated his
princedom from the year 1400, and assumed the full title and authority
of a monarch.<a id="notetag186" name="notetag186"></a><a
href="#note186">[186]</a> In this year he commissioned Griffin Young his
chancellor, and John Hangmer, both "his beloved relatives," to treat
with the King of France, in consideration of the affection and sincere
love which that illustrious monarch had shown <i>towards him</i> and <i>his
subjects</i>.<a id="notetag187" name="notetag187"></a><a
href="#note187">[187]</a> This commission is dated "Doleguelli, 10th
May, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span>
1404, and in the fourth year of our principality." In conformity with
its tenour, a league was made and sworn to between the ambassadors of
"<i>our illustrious and most dread lord, Owyn, Prince of Wales</i>," and
those of the King of France. That sovereign signed the commission
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188">(p. 188)</a></span>
on the 14th of June; and the league was sealed in the
chancellor's house at Paris, on the 14th July. Its provisions are
chiefly directed against "Henry of Lancaster."</p>

<p>The reinforcements which Owyn Glyndowr received from France at the
opening of the campaign in the spring of 1404, enabled him not only to
lay siege to the castles in North and West Wales (as it was called),
but to make desperate inroads into England, as well about Shropshire
as in Herefordshire. A letter addressed to the council, June 10th, by
the sheriff, the receiver, and other gentlemen of the latter county,
conveys a most desponding representation of the state of those parts;
especially through the district of Archenfield. The bearer of this
letter was the Archdeacon of Hereford, Dean of Windsor, the same
person who wrote in such "haste and dread" to the King the year
before. Some parts of this letter deserve to be transcribed, they
afford so lively a description of the frightful calamities of a civil
war. "The Welsh rebels in great numbers have entered
Irchonfeld,<a id="notetag188" name="notetag188"></a><a href="#note188">[188]</a>
which is a division of the county of Hereford, and there they have
burnt houses, killed the inhabitants, taken prisoners, and ravaged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189">(p. 189)</a></span>
the country, to the great dishonour of our King, and the
insupportable damage of the county. We have often advertised the King
that such mischiefs would befal us. We have also now certain
information that within the next eight days the rebels are resolved to
make an attack in the March of Wales, to its utter ruin if speedy
succour be not sent. True it is, indeed, that we have no power to
shelter us, except that of Lord Richard of York and his men, far too
little to defend us. We implore you to consider this very perilous and
pitiable case, and to pray our sovereign lord that he will come in his
royal person, or send some person with sufficient power to rescue us
from the invasion of the aforesaid rebels; otherwise we shall be
utterly destroyed,&mdash;which God forbid! Whoever comes will, as we are
led to believe from the report of our spies, have to engage in battle,
or will have a very severe struggle, with the rebels. And, for God's
sake, remember that honourable and valiant man the Lord
Abergavenny,<a id="notetag189" name="notetag189"></a><a href="#note189">[189]</a>
who is on the very point of destruction if he be not
rescued. Written in haste at Hereford, June 10th."</p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190">(p. 190)</a></span>
King had in some measure anticipated this strong
memorial, by signing, on the very day preceding its
date,<a id="notetag190" name="notetag190"></a><a href="#note190">[190]</a>
a
commission of array to the sheriffs of Hereford, Worcester,
Gloucester, and Warwick to raise their counties and proceed forthwith
to join Richard of York, and to advance in one body with him for the
rescue of William Beauchamp, who was then straitly besieged in his
castle of Abergavenny, and entirely destitute. Though no mention is
here made of the Prince, nor any allusion to him, we have the best
evidence that he was personally engaged during this summer in
endeavouring to resist the violence and excesses of the rebels. He was
crippled by want of means; he was forced to pawn his few jewels for
the present support of himself and his retinue; and, when the money
raised on them was exhausted, he was compelled to assure the council
in the most direct terms, of his utter inability to remain on his
post, if they did not forthwith provide him with adequate supplies. He
seems to have acted both with vigour and discretion; and the council
placed throughout the fullest confidence in his judgment and
integrity.</p>

<p>Three documents at this point of time deserve especial attention. The
first is a letter, in French, from the Prince, addressed to his
father, and dated Worcester, 25th of June 1404; the second is another
letter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191">(p. 191)</a></span>
of the same date, written by the Prince to the
council; the third contains the resolutions adopted by them in
consequence of this communication.</p>

<p>It is very true that letters afford no infallible proof of the
writer's real sentiments and feelings; and it has been said, that
expressions of piety or affection in epistles of past ages are not to
be interpreted as indices of the mind and state of him who utters
them, any more than the ordinary close of a note in the present day
proves that it came from a humble-minded and gratefully obliged
person. Nevertheless, with these general suggestions before us, and
not impugned, there does seem to pervade the following letter from
Henry to his father, somewhat more than words of course, or
matter-of-form expressions, indicative (unless the writer be a
hypocrite,&mdash;and hypocrisy has never been laid to Henry of Monmouth's
charge<a id="notetag191" name="notetag191"></a><a href="#note191">[191]</a>)
of filial dutifulness and affection, as well as of a
pious and devout trust in Providence. At all events, it is incumbent
on those who forbid our inference in favour of any one from such
testimony to show some act, or to quote some words, or direct us to
some implied sentiments in the individual, whose letters
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192">(p. 192)</a></span>
we
are discussing, which would give presumptive evidence against our
decision in his favour. But history has assigned no act, no sentiment,
no word of an irreligious or immoral tendency, to Henry of Monmouth up
to the date of this letter. It is not here implied, or conceded, that
history possesses facts of another character subsequently to this
date; that point must be the subject of our further inquiry. When this
letter was written, as far as we can ascertain, fame had not begun to
breathe a whisper against the religious and moral character of the
Prince of Wales.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p><span class="smcap">LETTER FROM PRINCE HENRY TO THE KING HIS FATHER.</span></p>
<p>
     "My very dread and sovereign lord and father.&mdash;In the most humble
     and obedient manner that I know or am able, I commend myself to
     your high Majesty, desiring every day your gracious blessing, and
     sincerely thanking your noble Highness for your honourable
     letters, which you were lately pleased to send to me, written at
     your Castle of Pontefract, the 21st day of this present month of
     June [1404]; by which letters I have been made acquainted with
     the great prosperity of your high and royal estate, which is to
     me the greatest joy that can fall to my lot in this world. And I
     have taken the very highest pleasure and entire delight at the
     news, of which you were pleased to certify me; first, of the
     speedy arrival of my very dear cousin, the Earl of Westmoreland,
     and William Clifford, to your Highness; and secondly, the arrival
     of the despatches from your adversary of Scotland, and other
     great men of his kingdom, by virtue of your safe conduct, for the
     good of both the kingdoms, which God of his mercy grant; and that
     you may
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193">(p. 193)</a></span>
     accomplish all your honourable designs, to his
     pleasure, to your honour, and the welfare of your kingdom, as I
     have firm reliance in Him who is omnipotent, that you will do. My
     most dread and sovereign lord and father, at your high command in
     other your gracious letters, I have removed with my small
     household to the city of Worcester; and at my request there is
     come to me, with a truly good heart, my very dear and beloved
     cousin, the Earl of Warwick, with a fine retinue at his own very
     heavy expenses; so he well deserves thanks from you for his
     goodwill at all times.</p>

<p>"And whether the news from the Welsh be true, and what measures I
     purpose to adopt on my arrival, as you desire to be informed, may
     it please your Highness to know that the Welsh have made a
     descent on Herefordshire, burning and destroying also the county,
     with very great force, and with a supply of provisions for
     fifteen days. And true it is that they have burnt and made very
     great havoc on the borders of the said county. But, since my
     arrival in these parts, I have heard of no further damage from
     them, God be thanked! But I am informed for certain that they are
     assembled with all their power, and keep themselves together for
     some important object, and, as it is said, to burn the said
     county. For this reason I have sent for my beloved cousins, my
     Lord Richard of York and the Earl Marshal, and others the most
     considerable persons of the counties of that march, to be with me
     at Worcester on the Tuesday next after the date of this letter,
     to inform me plainly of the government of their districts; and
     how many men they will be able to bring, if need be; and to give
     me their advice as to what may seem to them best to be done for
     the safeguard of the aforesaid parts. And, agreeably to their
     advice, I will do all I possibly can to resist the rebels and
     save the English country, to the utmost of my little power, as
     God shall give me grace: ever trusting in your high Majesty to
     remember my poor estate;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194">(p. 194)</a></span>
     and that I have not the means
     of continuing here without the adoption of some other measures
     for my maintenance; and that the expenses are insupportable to
     me. And may you thus make an ordinance for me with speed, that I
     may do good service, to your honour and the preservation of my
     humble state. My dread sovereign lord and father, may the
     allpowerful Lord of heaven and earth grant you a blessed and long
     life in all good prosperity, to your satisfaction! Written at
     Worcester the 26th day of June.<br>
<span class="left20">
     "Your humble and obedient Son,</span> <span class="smcap">Henry</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>The second letter, written at the same time and place, but addressed
to the council, is nearly word for word identical with this till
towards its close, when it gives the following strong view of the
straits and difficulties to which the Prince and the government were
then driven by want of
money;<a id="notetag192" name="notetag192"></a><a href="#note192">[192]</a>
and the personal sacrifice which he
was himself compelled to make. "We implore you to make some ordinance
for us in time, assured that we have nothing from which we can support
ourselves here, except that we have pawned our little plate and
jewels, and raised money from them, and with that we shall be able to
remain only a short time. And after that, unless you make provision
for us, we shall
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195">(p. 195)</a></span>
be compelled to depart with disgrace and
mischief: and the country will be utterly destroyed; which God forbid!
And now, since we have shown you the perils and mischiefs [which must
ensue], for God's sake make your ordinance in time, for the salvation
of the honour of our sovereign lord the King our father, of ourselves,
and of the whole realm. And may our Lord protect you, and give you
grace to do right!"</p>

<p>The Prince, finding his difficulties increasing, wrote another letter,
dated June 30, to the council, urging them to prompt measures; and
stating in very positive terms the utter impossibility of his
remaining in those parts without supplies. What immediate notice was
taken of these pressing communications, does not appear; that the
council enabled him to remain on the borders, and to protect the
country effectually from the rebels, is proved by their proceedings at
Lichfield on the 29th and 30th of the August following. The minutes of
those two councils are full of interest. By the first we are informed
that the French, under the French Earl of March, had equipped a fleet
of sixty vessels in the port of Harfleur, full of soldiers, for the
purpose of an immediate invasion of Wales. To meet this rising
mischief, the council advise that, since the King could not soon raise
an army proportionate to his high estate and dignity, to proceed
forthwith into Wales, he should remain at Tutbury until the meeting of
parliament at Coventry in the October following;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196">(p. 196)</a></span>
and in the
mean time proclamations should be made, directing all able-bodied men
to be ready to attend the King. Orders were also given to the officers
of the customs in Bristol to supply wine, corn, and other provisions
for the soldiers in the town of Caermarthen, in part payment of their
wages. The minutes then record, that, with regard to the county of
Hereford, the sheriff and the other gentlemen had requested the lords
of the council to pray the King that he would be pleased to thank the
Prince for the good protection of the said county since the Nativity
of St. John (June 24th), and likewise, that for the well-being of that
county, and also of the county of Gloucester, the Prince might be
assigned to guard the marches of the said counties, and to make
inroads into Overwent and Netherwent, Glamorgan and Morgannoc; and "to
carry this into effect, they must provide the wages of five hundred
men-at-arms and two thousand archers for three weeks, and through
another three weeks three hundred men-at-arms and two thousand
archers." In another council, probably at the end of August, the lords
recommend that the sum of 3000 marks, due to the King as a fine from
the inhabitants of Cheshire, to be paid in three years, should be
assigned to the Prince for the safeguard of the castle of Denbigh, and
towards the expenses of his other castles in North
Wales.<a id="notetag193" name="notetag193"></a><a href="#note193">[193]</a>
They
recommend also
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page197" name="page197">(p. 197)</a></span>
that the people of Shropshire be allowed to
make a truce with Wales until the last day of November; and with
regard to Herefordshire, that the Prince remain on its borders to the
last day of September, and have the same number of men-at-arms and
archers (or more) as he had had since the 29th of June; that he have
on his own account 1000 marks, and that on the first day of October he
be ready with five hundred men-at-arms and two thousand archers to
make an incursion into Wales, and stay there twenty-one days, for the
just chastisement of the rebels. And since for these charges the
Prince should be paid before his departure, measures had been taken to
raise money of several persons by way of loan. Sir John Oldcastle and
John ap Herry were to keep the castles of Brecknock and the Haye till
Michaelmas. The King also issued his mandate, 13th November 1404, to
the sheriffs of Worcester, Gloucester, and other counties, to provide
a contingent each of twenty men-at-arms and two hundred archers to
join the army of his sons; premising that he had, by the advice of his
parliament, sent his two sons, the Prince and the Lord Thomas, to
raise the siege of
Coitey,<a id="notetag194" name="notetag194"></a><a href="#note194">[194]</a>
in which Alexander Berkroller, lord of
that place, was then besieged: we may therefore safely conclude that,
through the first part of the winter at least, young Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198">(p. 198)</a></span>
was most fully occupied in the
Principality.<a id="notetag195" name="notetag195"></a><a href="#note195">[195]</a></p>

<p>Of the Prince's proceedings in consequence of these instructions we
hear nothing before the beginning of the next March: but through the
winter<a id="notetag196" name="notetag196"></a><a href="#note196">[196]</a>
(as it should seem) the Welsh chieftain and his French
auxiliaries were most busily engaged, especially towards the northern
parts. Indeed, it may be surmised, not without probable reason, that
the King's troops under the Prince in Monmouthshire, Glamorganshire,
and its adjacent districts, and perhaps the forces of Thomas Beaufort,
or the Duke of York, in Caermarthen, had driven Owyn and his partisans
northward, by the vigorous efforts which they made through the autumn
and the early part of the winter. To this season also we are induced
to refer those despatches from Conway and
Chester,<a id="notetag197" name="notetag197"></a><a href="#note197">[197]</a>
which give the
most alarming accounts to the King of the insolence and activity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199">(p. 199)</a></span>
of his enemies, and the imminent peril of his friends, his
castles, and the whole country. One letter speaks of six ships coming
out of France "with wyn and spicery full laden." Another reports that
the constable of Harlech had been seized by the Welsh and carried to
Owyn Glyndowr; and that the castle was in great danger of falling into
his hands, being garrisoned only by five Englishmen and about sixteen
Welshmen. A third apprises the King that the deputy-constable of
Caernarvon had sent a woman to inform the writer, William Venables,
the constable of Chester, (by word of mouth, because no man dared to
come, and no man or woman could carry letters safely,) of Owyn
Glyndowr's purpose, in conjunction with the French, "to assault the
town and castle of Caernarvon with engines,
sows,<a id="notetag198" name="notetag198"></a><a href="#note198">[198]</a>
and ladders of
very great length;" whilst in the town and castle there were not more
than twenty-eight fighting men,&mdash;eleven of the more able of those who
were there at the former siege being dead, some of their wounds,
others of the plague. In the fourth, the constable of Conway informs
the same parties that the people of Caernarvonshire purposed to go
into Anglesey to bring out of it all the men and cattle into the
mountains, "lest Englishmen should be refreshed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200">(p. 200)</a></span>
therewith."
The writer adds, "I durst lay my head that, if there were two hundred
men in Caernarvon and two hundred in Conway, from February until May,
the commons of Caernarvonshire would come to peace, and pay their dues
as well as ever. But should there be a delay till the summer, it will
not be so lightly (likely), for then the rebels will be able to lie
without (in the open air), as they cannot now do. Also I have myself
heard many of the commons and gentlemen of Merionethshire and
Caernarvonshire swear that all men of the aforesaid shires, except
four or five gentlemen and a few vagabonds (vacaboundis), would fain
come to peace, provided Englishmen were left in the country to help in
protecting them from misdoers; especially must they come into the
country whilst the weather is cold." In the fifth letter, we learn
that Owyn had agreed with all the men in the castle of Harlech, except
seven, to have deliverance of the castle on an early fixed day for a
stated sum of gold. A letter, dated Oswestry, February 7th, from the
Earl of Arundel and Surrey, conveys the very same sentiments with
those of the constable of Conway as to the probability of the
immediate termination of the rebellion, either by peace or victory,
should any vigorous measures be adopted. He was appointed to take
charge of Oswestry, with thirty men-at-arms and one hundred and fifty
archers, for eight weeks. He complains that the grand ordinance
resolved upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201">(p. 201)</a></span>
by the late parliament at
Coventry<a id="notetag199" name="notetag199"></a><a href="#note199">[199]</a>
had
not been put into execution; and states that the rebels were never at
any time so high or proud, from an assurance that it, like the others,
would become a dead
letter.<a id="notetag200" name="notetag200"></a><a href="#note200">[200]</a></p>

<p>The letter from Henry to his father in the preceding June, and the
testimony of the gentlemen of Hereford, who prayed that thanks might
be presented to the Prince for his watchful and efficient protection
of their county, inform us that the rebels towards the south marches
had been kept in check since the Prince's arrival; but they were ready
to renew their violence at the very opening of spring. Two letters,
one from the King to his council, the other from the Prince to the
King, require to be translated literally, and copied into these pages.
The former, which is now published for the first time in "The Acts of
the Privy Council," proves the hearty good-will entertained by the
King towards his son, and the lively paternal interest he took up to
that time in his honourable career. It assures us also of the great
importance attached by the King to the victory then gained over the
rebels. The latter, though published by Rymer and Ellis, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202">(p. 202)</a></span>
others, and though often commented upon before, yet appears to throw
so much light upon the character of Prince Henry as a Christian at
once and a warrior, especially in that union of valour and mercy in
him to which Hotspur first bore testimony four years before, that any
treatise on the life and character of Henry of Monmouth would be
altogether defective were this letter to be omitted. The King's letter
to his council bears date Berkhemstead, March 13, 1405.</p>

<div class="letter">
     <p>"<span class="smcap">From the King.</span></p>

     <p>"Very dear and faithful! We greet you well. And since we know
     that you are much pleased and rejoiced whenever you can hear good
     news relating to the preservation of our honour and estate, and
     especially of the common good and honour of the whole realm, we
     forward to you for your consolation the copy of a letter sent to
     us by our very dear son, the Prince, touching his government in
     the marches of Wales; by which you will yourselves become
     acquainted with the news for which we return thanks to Almighty
     God. We beg you will convey these tidings to our very dear and
     faithful friends the Mayor and good people of our city of London,
     in order that they may derive consolation from them together with
     us, and praise our Creator for them. May He always have you in
     his holy keeping.&mdash;Given under our signet at our Castle of
     Berkhemstead, the 13th day of March."</p></div>


<p>The following letter, the copy of which the King then forwarded, was
written by the Prince at Hereford, on the 11th of March, at night.</p>

     <p>"My most redoubted and most sovereign lord and father, in the
     most humble manner that in my heart I can devise, I commend
     myself to your royal Majesty, humbly requesting your gracious
     blessing. My most redoubted and most sovereign lord and father, I
     sincerely pray that God will graciously show his miraculous aid
     toward you in all places: praised be He in all his works! For on
     Wednesday, the eleventh day of this present month of March, your
     rebels of the parts of Glamorgan, Morgannoc, Usk, Netherwent, and
     Overwent, were assembled to the number of eight thousand men
     according to their own account; and they went on the said
     Wednesday in the morning, and burnt part of your town of Grosmont
     within your lordship of Monmouth. And I
immediately<a id="notetag201" name="notetag201"></a><a href="#note201">[201]</a>
sent off
     my very dear cousin the Lord Talbot, and the small body of my own
     household, and with them joined your faithful and gallant knights
     William Neuport and John Greindre; who were but a very small
     force in all. But very true it is that <span class="smcap">VICTORY IS NOT IN A
     MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE, BUT IN THE POWER OF GOD</span>; and this was well
     proved there. And there, by the aid of the blessed Trinity, your
     people gained the field, and slew of them by fair account on the
     field, by the time of their return from the pursuit, some say
     eight hundred, and some say a thousand, being questioned on pain
     of death. Nevertheless, whether on such an account it were one or
     the other I would not contend.</p>

     <p>"And, to inform you fully of all that has been done, I send you a
     person worthy of credit in this case, my faithful servant the
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204">(p. 204)</a></span>
     bearer of this letter, who was present at the
     engagement, and did his duty very satisfactorily, as he does on
     all occasions. And such amends has God ordained you for the
     burning of four houses of your said town. And prisoners there
     were none taken excepting
one,<a id="notetag202" name="notetag202"></a><a href="#note202">[202]</a>
who was a great chieftain
     among them, whom I would have sent to you, but he <i>cannot yet
     ride at his ease</i>.</p>

     <p>"And touching the governance which I purpose to make after this,
     please your Highness to give sure credence to the bearer of this
     letter in whatever he shall lay before your Highness on my part.
     And I pray God that He will preserve you always in joy and
     honour, and grant me shortly to comfort you with other good news.
     Written at Hereford, the said Wednesday, at night.<br>

  "Your very humble and obedient son,</span>

<span class="poem1">and sovereign lord and father."</span></p></div>



<p>The true reading of "I sent," instead of "Jennoia," at first might
seem to imply that the Prince was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205">(p. 205)</a></span>
not present in person at
the battle of Grosmont: and there is no positive evidence in the
letter to show that he was there. The testimony which he bears to the
gallant conduct in that field of his faithful servant, whom he
despatched with his letter, has been thought to sanction a belief,
that Henry was an eyewitness of the engagement. But from this doubt
the mind turns with full satisfaction to the religious sentiments
which are interwoven throughout the epistle, and to Henry's
considerate and humane treatment of his prisoner. He would, no doubt,
have felt a satisfaction and pride in immediately placing a high
chieftain of Wales in the hands of the King, on the very day of battle
and victory; but he shrunk from gratifying his own wishes, when his
pleasure involved the pain of a fellow-creature, though that person
was his prisoner. Many an incident throughout his life tends to
justify Shakspeare, when he makes Henry IV. speak of his son's
philanthropy and tenderness of feeling:</p>

<p class="poem">
"He hath a tear for pity, and a hand<br>
Open as day for melting charity."<br>

<span class="left30">2</span> <span class="smcap">Henry</span> IV. act iv. sc. iv.
</p>

<p>Those united qualities of valour and mercy, of courage and kindness of
heart, which are so beautifully ascribed to a modern English warrior,
were never blended in any character of which history speaks in more
perfect harmony than in Henry of Monmouth:</p>

<p class="figcenter smsize"> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206">(p. 206)</a></span>
    "A furious lion in battle;<br>
But, duty appeased, in mercy a lamb."</p>


<p>The lesson thus taught him during his early youth in the field of
Grosmont, whether by personal experience of that conflict, or by the
representation of his gallant companions in arms, of what may be
effected by courage and discipline against an enemy infinitely
superior in numbers, was probably not forgotten, ten years afterwards,
at Agincourt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">rebellion of northumberland and bardolf. &mdash; execution of the
archbishop of york. &mdash; wonderful activity and resolution of the king.
&mdash; deplorable state of the revenue. &mdash; testimony borne by parliament
to the prince's character. &mdash; the prince present at the council-board.
&mdash; he is only occasionally in wales, and remains for the most part in
london.</span><br><br>


1405-1406.</h3>


<p>Whilst the Prince was thus exerting himself to the utmost in keeping
the Welsh rebels in check, the King resolved to go once again in
person to the Principality with as strong a force as he could muster;
and with this intention he set forward, probably about the end of
April. On the 8th of May he was at Worcester, when he was suddenly
informed of the hostile measures of his enemies in the north. The
preface to "The Acts of the Privy Council" gives the following
succinct and clear account of the proceedings:&mdash;"The most memorable
event in the sixth year of Henry IV. was the revolt, in May 1405, of
the Earl Marshal, Lord Bardolf, and the Earl of Northumberland, who
had been partially restored to the King's confidence after the death
of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208">(p. 208)</a></span>
son and brother in
1403.<a id="notetag203" name="notetag203"></a><a href="#note203">[203]</a>
Henry was at that
moment at Worcester; and the earliest notice of the rebellion is
contained in a letter from the council to the King, which, after
treating of various matters, concluded by stating that they were then
just informed by his Majesty's son, John of Lancaster, that Lord
Bardolf had privately withdrawn himself to the north; at which they
were much astonished, because the King had ordered him to proceed into
Wales. To guard against any ill consequences which might arise from
this suspicious circumstance, the council instantly despatched in the
same direction Lord Roos and Sir William Gascoyne, the Chief Justice,
as the individuals in whom the King placed most confidence; and,
thinking that Henry might be in want of money, the council borrowed
and sent him one thousand marks. With his accustomed promptitude and
activity, the King lost not a moment in setting off for the north, to
meet the rebellious lords in person; and on the 28th of May he wrote
to his council from Derby, acquainting them with the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209">(p. 209)</a></span>
revolt,
and desiring them to hasten to him at Pomfret with as many followers
as possible."</p>

<p>The Editor of the Proceedings of the Privy Council says nothing of
Scrope, Archbishop of York, who had risen in open rebellion against
the royal authority; but we cannot pass on without some notice of him.
Early in June, King Henry laid hands on that unfortunate prelate,
surrounded by followers, and armed in a coat of mail; and he commanded
Gascoyne, who was with him, to pass sentence of death upon his
prisoner in a summary way. The Chief Justice
refused,<a id="notetag204" name="notetag204"></a><a href="#note204">[204]</a>
with these
words: "Neither you, my lord the King, nor any of your lieges acting
in your name, can lawfully, according to the laws of the kingdom,
condemn any bishop to death." The King then ordered one Fulthorp to
sentence him to decapitation, who forthwith complied; and the
Archbishop was carried to execution with every mark of disgrace, on
Whitmonday, June 8th. Many legends shortly became current about this
warlike prelate, who was one of the most determined enemies of the
House of Lancaster. Of the stories propagated soon after his death,
one declares that in the field of his last earthly struggle the corn
was trodden down, and destroyed irremediably, both by his enemies, who
were preparing for his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210">(p. 210)</a></span>
execution, and by his friends and
poor neighbours, who came to weep and bewail the fate of their beloved
chief pastor. The Archbishop, seeing the destruction which his death
was causing, spoke with words of comfort to the multitude, and
promised to intercede with heaven that the evil might be averted. The
field, continues the story, brought forth at the ensuing harvest
six-fold above the average crop. The same page tells that the King was
smitten with the leprosy in the face on the very hour of the very day
in which the Archbishop was beheaded. The manuscript adds, that many
miracles were shown day by day by the Lord at the tomb of this
prelate, to which people flocked from every side. The enemies of the
King endeavoured to exalt this zealous son of the church into a saint;
and to propagate the belief that the King's disease, which never left
him, was a signal and miraculous visitation of Heaven, avenging the
foul murder of so dauntless a
martyr.<a id="notetag205" name="notetag205"></a><a href="#note205">[205]</a></p>

<p>Pope Innocent, in the course of the year, sent a peremptory mandate to
the Archbishop of Canterbury to fulminate the curse of excommunication
against all those who had participated in the prelate's murder: but
the Archbishop did not dare to execute the mandate; for both the King
and a large body of the nobility were implicated more or less directly
in Scrope's execution, and must have been involved in the same general
sentence. The King,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211">(p. 211)</a></span>
on hearing of the decided countenance
thus given by the Pope to his rebellious subjects, despatched a
messenger to Rome, conveying the military vest of the Archbishop, and
charged him to present it to his Holiness; delivering at the same
time, as his royal master's message, the words of Jacob's sons, "Lo!
this have we found; know now whether it be thy son's coat, or no." A
passage in Hardyng seems to imply that, during the life of Henry IV,
the devotions of the people to this warrior bishop were forbidden; for
he records, apparently with approbation, the permission granted by his
son Henry V, to all persons to make their offerings at the shrine of
their sainted prelate:</p>

<p class="poem">
"He gave then, of good devotion,<br>
 All men to offer to Bishop Scrope express,<br>
 Without letting or any question."</p>


<p>"Before the end of the next month
(June),<a id="notetag206" name="notetag206"></a><a href="#note206">[206]</a>
Henry was engaged in
besieging the Earl of Northumberland's castles; and in a letter to the
council, dated Warkworth, on the 2nd of July, he informed them that
Prudhoe Castle had immediately surrendered: but that the Castle of
Warkworth, being well garrisoned, refused to obey his summons; the
captain having declared as his final answer that he would defend it
for the Earl. The King had therefore ordered his artillery to be
brought against it, which were so ably served, that at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212">(p. 212)</a></span>
the
seventh discharge the besieged implored his mercy, and the fortress
was delivered into his hands on the 1st of July. All the other castles
had imitated the example of Prudhoe, excepting Alnwick, which he was
then about to attack."</p>

<p>"The exhausted state of the King's pecuniary resources," continues the
Preface, "and the distress endured by the soldiers and others engaged
in his service, are forcibly shown by the letters of the Prince of
Wales, the Duke of York, and others. The Duke of York, and his brother
Richard, described their retinues in Wales as being in a state of
mutiny for want of their wages; and the Duke had evidently made every
personal sacrifice within his power to satisfy them. He entreated them
to continue there a few weeks longer, authorised them to mortgage his
land in Yorkshire, pledged himself "on his truth, and as he is a true
gentleman," not to receive any part of his revenues until his soldiers
were paid, and promised that he would not ask them to continue longer
than the time specified. Every source of income seems to have been
anticipated; and it is scarcely possible to conceive a government in
greater distress for money than was Henry IV's at this point of time.
Nothing but the wisdom and indomitable energy for which that monarch
was distinguished could have enabled him to surmount the difficulties
of his position; and the facts detailed in this
volume<a id="notetag207" name="notetag207"></a><a href="#note207">[207]</a>
entitle
Henry to a high rank
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213">(p. 213)</a></span>
among the most distinguished of
European sovereigns both as a soldier and as a statesman. No sooner
had he suppressed rebellion in one place than it showed itself in
another; and, for many years, the Welsh could barely be kept in check
by the presence of the Prince of Wales and a large army. By France he
was constantly annoyed; and, if he was not actually at war with the
Scotch, it was necessary to watch their conduct with great anxiety and
suspicion. To add to his embarrassment, the great mass of his own
subjects were tempted to revolt by the distracted condition of the
country, by the existence of the true heir to the throne, and by
reports that their former sovereign was yet alive. Henry's treatment
of them was necessarily firm, but conciliatory. He dared not recruit
his exhausted finances by heavy impositions on the people; and the
generous sacrifices made by the peers to avoid so dangerous an
expedient had reduced them to poverty."</p>

<p>Such is the clear and able representation given to us of the state of
the kingdom at large, and of the difficulties with which Henry IV. and
his supporters had to struggle, whilst Henry of Monmouth was exerting
himself to the very utmost in repressing the rebels in
Wales.<a id="notetag208" name="notetag208"></a><a href="#note208">[208]</a>
His
means were, indeed, very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214">(p. 214)</a></span>
limited; he seldom had a "large
army" at his command; and his measures were lamentably embarrassed by
the exhausted state of the treasury. The King endeavoured from time to
time, in some cases successfully, at others with a total failure, to
remedy these evils, and to supply his son with the power of acting in
a manner worthy of himself, and the importance of the enterprise in
which he was engaged. On the 31st of May he despatched a letter to his
council from Nottingham, which contains many interesting particulars;
whilst the total inability of his ministers to comply with his
directions speaks very strongly of the trying circumstances in which
the Prince was trained. The King begins by reminding the council that
it was by the advice of them and other nobles, and the commons of the
realm, that the defence of Wales was committed to his very dear and
beloved son the Prince, as his lieutenant there; at the time of whose
appointment it was agreed, that since he had in his retinue a certain
number of men-at-arms and archers, though for the protection of the
realm, yet living at his expense, he should receive a certain
proportion of the subsidy voted at the last parliament. The King then
representing to them the vast mischiefs which would befal the marches,
and by consequence the whole realm, if the rebels were not effectually
resisted, strictly charges and commands his council, with all possible
speed to make payment in part of whatever the Prince was to receive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215">(p. 215)</a></span>
from the King on that account. And though the Prince had
under him the Duke of York living there for the safeguard of the
country, nevertheless the King desired that the money paid for the
whole country of Wales should be put wholly and exclusively into the
hands of the Prince himself, to be employed and disbursed at his
discretion, with the advice of his council. The reason for this last
order he alleges to be the assurance given to him that the sums on
former occasions paid to others under the Prince for his use had not
been expended properly to the profit of the marches, nor agreeably to
the intention of the King and council. He ends his letter by enjoining
them, for the love they bore to him, and the confidence he placed in
them, to pay hearty attention to this subject. Notwithstanding this
urgent appeal, the council reply that the assignments already made,
and the payments absolutely indispensable, together with the failure
of the supplies, would not suffer them to meet his wishes. This answer
was written on a Monday, probably the 8th of June. On the 12th we find
the King (it may be, to make some little compensation for this
disappointment,) assigning to the Prince, in aid of his sustentation,
the castle and estates of Framlyngham, which had fallen to the crown
by forfeiture from Thomas Mowbray.</p>

<p>The rapid movements of the King in those days of incessant alarm are
quite astonishing. Just as in the battle of Shrewsbury he impressed
the enemy with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216">(p. 216)</a></span>
an idea of his ubiquity throughout the whole
field, so at this time, from day to day, he appears in whatever part
of the kingdom his presence seemed to be most needed. On the 7th of
August he was at Pontefract, whither tidings were brought to him that
the French admiral, Hugevyn, had arrived at Milford to aid the Welsh
rebels; and he sent a commission of array to the sheriff of
Herefordshire to meet him. On the 4th of
September<a id="notetag209" name="notetag209"></a><a href="#note209">[209]</a>
we find him at
Hereford, attended by many nobles and others, where he issued a
warrant to raise money by way of loan, to enable him to resist the
Welsh.</p>

<p>In less than three weeks from this time the King was resident near
York, and promulgated an ordinance on the 22nd of September to the
sheriffs of Devon and other counties to meet him on the 10th of
October at Evesham; the body of this ordinance contained a very
interesting report which the King had received from "his most dear
first-born son," Henry Prince of Wales, whom he had left in that
country for the chastisement of the rebels. "Those," he says, "in the
castle of Llanpadarn have submitted to the Prince, and have sworn on
the body of the Lord, administered to them by the hands of our cousin
Richard Courtney, chancellor of Oxford, in the presence of the Duke of
York, that if we, or our son, or our lieutenant, shall not be removed
from the siege by Owyn Glyndowr between the 24th October next coming
at sunrising,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217">(p. 217)</a></span>
and the Feast of All Saints the next to come
(1st November), in that case the said rebels will restore the castle
in the same condition; and for greater security they have given
hostages. Wishing to preserve the state and honour of ourself, our
son, and the common good of England, which may be secured by the
conquest of that castle, (since probably by the conquest of that
castle the whole rebellion of the Welsh will be terminated, the
contrary to which is to be lamented by us and all our faithful
subjects,) we intend shortly to be present at that siege, on the 24th
of October, together with our son, or to send a sufficient deputy to
aid our son. We therefore command you to cause all who owe us suit and
service to meet us at Evesham on the 10th of October."</p>

<p>Towards the close of this year we are reminded again of the deplorable
state of the King's revenue, by the urgent remonstrance of Lord Grey
of Codnor, and the recommendation of the council in consequence. Lord
Grey complained that he could obtain no money from the King's
receivers, though they had warrants and commands to pay him: that he
had pawned his plate and other goods; and that, without redeeming
them, he could not remove from Caermarthen to
Brecon.<a id="notetag210" name="notetag210"></a><a href="#note210">[210]</a>
He then
prays
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218">(p. 218)</a></span>
that means may be adopted for payment of his debts and
the wages of his men, if the royal pleasure was for him to remain in
those parts, or else to allow him to be excused. The council advise
the King to make him Lieutenant of South Wales and West Wales,
considering his vast trouble in bringing his people from England; to
direct payment to be made to him from the revenues of Brecknock,
Kidwelly,
Monmouth,<a id="notetag211" name="notetag211"></a><a href="#note211">[211]</a>
and Oggmore, belonging to the Duchy of
Lancaster; and to grant him the commission to be Justice of those
parts during the time of his lieutenancy. He was appointed lieutenant
on the 2nd of December 1405, and continued so till the 1st of February
1406. The council also complained that the people of Pembrokeshire had
not done their duty in resisting the rebels, and recommended the King
to charge Lord Grey to make inquisition of the
defaulters.<a id="notetag212" name="notetag212"></a><a href="#note212">[212]</a>
</p>

<p>In the following year, on the 22nd of March 1406, Henry Beaufort
Bishop of Winchester, was commissioned to treat anew for a marriage
between Prince Henry and some "one of the daughters of our adversary
of France." But the negociation seems to have failed. On the 18th of
this month permission
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219">(p. 219)</a></span>
was given by the King to Edmund
Walsingham to ransom his brother Nicholas. The document gives a brief
but most significant account of the treatment which awaited Owyn's
captives. Walsingham, who was taken prisoner near Brecknock, was
plundered and kept in ward in so wretched and miserable a state that
he could scarcely survive. His ransom was to be
50<i>l.</i><a id="notetag213" name="notetag213"></a><a href="#note213">[213]</a></p>

<p>On the 3rd of April the Commons prayed the King to send his honourable
letters under his privy seal, thanking the Prince for the good and
constant labour and diligence which he had, and continued to have, in
resisting and chastening the rebels.</p>

<p>On the 5th of April a commission was given by the King to Lord Grey
and the Prior of Ewenny to execute "all contracts and
agreements<a id="notetag214" name="notetag214"></a><a href="#note214">[214]</a>
made by the Prince our dear son, whom we have appointed our Lieutenant
of North and South Wales, and have authorized to receive into
allegiance at his discretion our rebels up to the Feast of St. Martin
in Yeme."<a id="notetag215" name="notetag215"></a><a href="#note215">[215]</a></p>

<p>Very few events are recorded as having taken place through this spring
and summer which tend to throw light on the character or proceedings
of Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220">(p. 220)</a></span>
of Monmouth. He remained in Wales, probably without
leaving it for any length of time. The crown had been already settled
upon him and his three brothers in succession; but on the 22nd of
December this year, in full parliament, at the urgent instance of the
great people of the realm, the succession was again limited to Henry
the Prince and his three brothers, and their heirs, but not to the
exclusion of females.</p>

<p>The French made a more feeble attempt to assist Glyndowr, in 1406,
with a fleet of thirty-six vessels, the greater part of which was
shipwrecked in a
storm.<a id="notetag216" name="notetag216"></a><a href="#note216">[216]</a>
They had been more successful on their
former invasions of Wales: but they found in that wild and
impoverished country little to induce them to persevere in a struggle
which promised neither national glory nor individual profit; and they
left Owyn to drag out his war as he best could, depending on his own
resources.</p>

<p>It is with unalloyed satisfaction that we are able to record the
testimony which the Commons of England at this time, by the mouth of
their Speaker, bore to the character of Henry of Monmouth. It may seem
strange that no use has been made of this evidence by any historian,
not even by those who have undertaken to rescue his name from the
aspersions with which it has been assailed. The tribute of praise and
admiration for his son, then addressed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221">(p. 221)</a></span>
to the King on his
throne, in the midst of the assembled prelates, and peers, and commons
of the whole realm, is the more valuable because it bears on some of
those very points in which his reputation has been most attacked. The
vague tradition of subsequent chroniclers, the unbridled fancy of the
poet, the bitterness of polemical controversy, unite in representing
Henry as a self-willed, obstinate young man, regardless of every
object but his own gratification, "as dissolute as desperate," under
no control of feelings of modesty, with no reverence for his elders,
discarding all parental authority, reckless of consequences; his own
will being his only rule of conduct, his own pleasures the chief end
for which he seemed to live. These charges have been adopted, and
re-echoed, and sent down to posterity with gathered strength and
confirmation, by our poets, by our historians, civil and
ecclesiastical, by the ornaments of the legal profession,&mdash;even one of
our most celebrated Judges adding the weight of his name to the
general accusation. It is not the province of this work to vindicate
the character of Henry from charges brought against him: truth, not
eulogy, is its professed object, and will (the Author trusts) be found
to have been its object not in profession only. But, before the
verdict of guilty be returned against Henry, justice requires that the
evidence which his accusers offer be thoroughly sifted, and the
testimony of his contemporaries, solemnly given before the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222">(p. 222)</a></span>
assembled estates of the realm, must in common fairness be weighed
against the assertions of those who could have had no personal
knowledge of him, and who derived their views through channels of the
character and purity of which we are not assured. The evidence here
offered was given when Henry was towards the close of his nineteenth
year.</p>

<p>The Rolls of Parliament record the following as the substance of the
opening address made by the Speaker, on Monday, June 7, 1406, "to the
King seated on his royal throne." "He made a commendation of the many
excellencies and virtues which habitually dwelt [reposerent] in the
honourable person of the Prince; and especially, first, of the
humility and obedience which he bears towards our sovereign lord the
King, his father; so that there can be no person, of any degree
whatever, who entertains or shows more honour and reverence of
humbleness and obedience to his father than he shows in his honourable
person. Secondly, how God hath granted to him, and endowed him with
good heart and courage, as much as ever was needed in any such prince
in the world. And, thirdly, [he spoke] of the great virtue which God
hath granted him in an especial manner, that howsoever much he had set
his mind upon any important undertaking to the best of his own
judgment, yet for the great confidence which he placed in his council,
and in their loyalty, judgment, and discretion, he would kindly and
graciously be influenced, and conform
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223">(p. 223)</a></span>
himself to his council
and their ordinance, according to what seemed best to them, setting
aside entirely his own will and pleasure; from which it is probable
that, by the grace of God, very great comfort and honour and advantage
will flow hereafter. For this, the said Commons humbly thank our Lord
Jesus Christ, and they pray for its good continuance." Such is the
preface to the prayer of their petition that he might be acknowledged
by law as heir apparent.</p>

<p>It may be questioned, after every fair deduction has been made from
the intrinsic value of this testimony, on the ground of the
complimentary nature of such state-addresses in general, whether
history contains any document of undisputed genuineness which bears
fuller or more direct testimony to the union in the same prince of
undaunted valour, filial reverence and submission, respect for the
opinion of others, readiness to sacrifice his own will, and to follow
the advice of the wise and good, than this Roll of Parliament bears to
the character of Henry of Monmouth. And when we reflect to what a high
station he had been called whilst yet a boy; with what important
commissions he had been intrusted; how much fortune seems to have done
to spoil him by pride and vain-glory from his earliest youth, this
page of our national records seems to set him high among the princes
of the world; not so much as an undaunted warrior and triumphant hero,
as the conqueror of himself, the example of a chastened
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224">(p. 224)</a></span>
modest spirit, of filial reverence, and a single mind bent on his
duty. To all this Henry added that quality without which such a
combination of moral excellencies would not have existed, the
believing obedient heart of a true Christian. This last quality is not
named in words by the Speaker; but his immediate reference to the
grace of God, and his thanks in the name of the people of England to
the Almighty Saviour for having imparted these graces to their Prince,
appear to bring the question of his religious principles before our
minds. Whilst in seeking for the solution of that question we find
other pages of his history, equally genuine and authentic, which
assure us that he was a sincere and pious Christian, or else a
consummate hypocrite,&mdash;a character which his bitterest accusers have
never ventured to fasten upon
him.<a id="notetag217" name="notetag217"></a><a href="#note217">[217]</a></p>

<p class="p2">

<p>On the same day, June 7,
1406,<a id="notetag218" name="notetag218"></a><a href="#note218">[218]</a>
the Commons pray that Henry the
Prince may be commissioned to go into Wales with all possible haste,
considering the news that is coming from day to day of the rebellion
of the Earl of Northumberland, and others.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225">(p. 225)</a></span>
They also, June
19, declare the thanks of the nation to be due to Lord Grey, John
Greindore, Lord Powis, and the Earls of Chester and Salop. Henry
probably returned to the Principality without delay; but there is
reason to infer that, towards the autumn of this year, Owyn Glyndowr
felt himself too much impoverished and weakened to attempt any
important exploit; resolved not to yield, and yet unable to strike any
efficient blow. The Prince was thus left at liberty to visit London
for a while; and, on the 8th of December 1406, we find him present at
a council at Westminster. This council met to deliberate upon the
governance of the King's household; which seems to have drawn to
itself their serious attention by its extravagance and
mismanagement.<a id="notetag219" name="notetag219"></a><a href="#note219">[219]</a>
They requested that good and honest officers might
be appointed, especially a good controller. They even recommended two
by name, Thomas Bromflet and Arnaut Savari; and desired that the
steward and treasurer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page226" name="page226">(p. 226)</a></span>
might seek for others. They proposed
also that a proper sum should be provided for the household before
Christmas. The council then proceeded to make the following
suggestion, which probably could have been regarded by the King only
as an encroachment on his personal liberty and prerogative, a severe
reflection upon himself, and an indication of the unkind feelings of
those with whom it originated. "Also, it seems desirable that, the
said feast ended, our said sovereign the King should withdraw himself
to some convenient place, where, by the deliberation and advice of
himself and his council and officers, such moderate regulations might
be established in the said household as would thenceforth tend to the
pleasure of God and the people."</p>

<p>Whether the Prince took any part in these proceedings, or not, we are
left in ignorance. Equally in the dark are we as to his line of
conduct with regard to those thirty-one articles proposed by the
Commons, just a fortnight afterwards; articles evidently tending to
interfere with the royal prerogative, and to limit the powers and
increase the responsibility of the King's council. "The Speaker
requested that all the lords of the council should be sworn to observe
these articles;" but they refused to comply, unless the King, "of his
own motion," should specially command them to take the oath. This
proceeding respecting the council forms an important feature in its
history, as it proves the very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page227" name="page227">(p. 227)</a></span>
extensive manner in which the
Commons interested themselves in its measures and constitution.
Whether we may trace to these transactions, as their origin, the
differences which in after years show themselves plainly between the
King and his son, or whether other causes were then in operation,
which time has veiled from our sight, or which documents still in
existence, but hitherto unexamined, may bring again to light, we
cannot undertake to
determine.<a id="notetag220" name="notetag220"></a><a href="#note220">[220]</a>
Be that as it may, though from
this time we find Henry of Monmouth on some occasions in Wales, yet he
seems to have taken more and more a part in the management of the
nation at large; and, as he grew in the estimation of the great people
of the land, his royal father appears to have more and more retired
from public business, and to have sunk in importance. Few
documents<a id="notetag221" name="notetag221"></a><a href="#note221">[221]</a>
are preserved among the records now accessible which
give any information as to the Prince's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228">(p. 228)</a></span>
proceedings through
the year 1407; but those few are by no means devoid of interest, as
throwing some light upon the progress of the Welsh rebellion, and, in
a degree, on Henry's character being at the same time confirmatory of
the view above taken of his occupations.</p>

<p>The Prince had laid siege to the castle of Aberystwith, situate near
the town of Llanpadern; but how long he had been before that fortress,
or, indeed, at what time he had returned to the Principality, history
does not record. If, as we may infer, the King did retire, according
to the suggestion of the council, "to some convenient place," the
Prince's presence was more required in London; whilst, Owyn's power
being evidently at that time on the decline, the necessity of his
personal exertions in Wales became less urgent. No accounts of the
proceedings either of Owyn, of the King, or of the Prince, at this
precise period seem to have reached our time. Probably nothing beyond
the siege of a castle, or an indecisive skirmish, took place during
the spring and summer. Among the documents, to which allusion has just
been made, one bears date September 12, 1407, containing an agreement
between Henry Prince of Wales on the one part, and, on the other, Rees
ap Gryffith and his associates. The Welshmen stipulate not to destroy
the houses, nor molest the shipping, should any arrive; and the Prince
covenants to give them free egress for their persons and goods. The
motives by which he professes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229">(p. 229)</a></span>
to be influenced are very
curious: "For the reverence of God and All Saints, and especially also
of his own patron, John of
Bridlington;<a id="notetag222" name="notetag222"></a><a href="#note222">[222]</a>
for the saving of human
blood; and at the petition of Richard ap Gryffyth, Abbot of
Stratflorida."</p>

<p>Eight years after this, 23rd January 1415, a petition, which presents
more than one point of curiosity, was preferred to Henry of Monmouth,
then King, with reference to this siege of Aberystwith. Gerard Strong
prays that the King would issue a warrant commanding the treasurer and
barons of the exchequer to grant him a discharge for the metal of a
brass cannon burst at the siege of Aberystwith; of a cannon called
<i>The King's Daughter</i>, burst at the siege of Harlech; of a cannon
burst in proving it by Anthony Gunner, at Worcester; of a cannon with
two chambers; two iron guns, with gunpowder; and cross-bows and
arrows, delivered to various castles." The King granted the petition
in all its prayer. This petitioner was perhaps encouraged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230">(p. 230)</a></span>
to
prefer his memorial by the success with which another suit had been
urged, only in the preceding month (13th December 1414), with
reference to the same period. John Horne, citizen and fishmonger of
London, presented to Henry V. and his council a petition in these
words: "When you were Prince, his vessel laden with provisions was
arrested (pressed) for the service of Lords Talbot and Furnivale, and
their soldiers, at the siege of
Harlech;<a id="notetag223" name="notetag223"></a><a href="#note223">[223]</a>
which siege would have
failed had those supplies not been furnished by him, as Lord Talbot
certifies. On unlading and receiving payment, the rebels came upon
him, burnt his ship, took himself prisoner, and fixed his ransom at
twenty marks. He was liable to be imprisoned for the debt which he
owed for the cargo." The King granted his petition, and ordered him to
be paid. Henry was then on the point of leaving England for Normandy;
and these reminiscences of his early campaigns might have presented
themselves to his thoughts with agreeable associations, and rendered
his ear more ready to listen to petitions, which seem at all events to
have been presented somewhat tardily.</p>

<p>An important circumstance, hitherto unobserved by writers on these
times, is incidentally recorded in the Pell Rolls. Prince Henry is
there reimbursed, on June 1, 1409, a much larger sum than usual
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231">(p. 231)</a></span>
for the pay of his men-at-arms and archers in Wales; and is in
the same entry stated to have been retained by the consent of the
council, on the 12th of the preceding May, to remain in attendance on
the person of the King, and at his bidding. The
Latin<a id="notetag224" name="notetag224"></a><a href="#note224">[224]</a>
might be
thought to leave it in doubt whether this absence from his
Principality, and constant attendance on the King, was originally the
result of his own wishes, or his father's, or at the suggestion of the
council. But the circumstance of the consent of the council being
recorded proves that Henry's absence from Wales and residence in
London were not the mere result of his own will and pleasure,
independently of the wishes of those whom he ought to respect; but
were at all events in accordance with the expressed approbation of his
father and the council. Probably the plan originated with the council,
the Prince willingly accepting the office, the King intimating his
consent.</p>

1407-1409.</h3>


<p>Though our own documents fail to supply us with any further
information as to the proceedings of Henry of Monmouth through the
year 1407, and though he might have been allowed some breathing time
by the decreased energy of the Welsh rebels, yet Monstrelet informs us
that he was actively engaged in a campaign at the other extremity of
the kingdom. The historian thus introduces his readers to this affair:
"How the Prince of Wales, eldest son
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233">(p. 233)</a></span>
of the King of England,
accompanied by his two uncles and a very great body of chivalry, went
into Scotland to make war." He then commences his chapter by the not
very usual assurance that he is about to relate a matter of fact.
"Then it is the truth that at this time, 1407, about the Feast of All
Saints (1st November), Henry Prince of
Wales<a id="notetag225" name="notetag225"></a><a href="#note225">[225]</a>
mustered an army of
one thousand men-at-arms and six thousand archers; among whom were his
two uncles, the Duke of York, the Earl of Dorset, the Lords Morteines,
de Beaumont, de Rol, and Cornwal, together with many other noblemen;
who all marched towards Scotland, chiefly because the Scots had lately
broken the truce between the two kingdoms, and done great damage by
fire and sword in the duchy of Lancaster, and the district around
Roxburgh. The Scots were not aware of their approach till they were
near at hand, and had committed great devastation. As soon as the King
of Scotland, who was at the town of Saint "Iango" (Andrew's) in the
middle of his kingdom, heard of it, he issued orders immediately to
his chiefs; and in a few days a powerful army was assembled, which he
sent under the command of the Earl of Douglas and Buchan towards the
Marches. But, when they were within
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234">(p. 234)</a></span>
six leagues, they learnt
that the English were too strong for them. They consequently sent
ambassadors to the Prince of Wales and his council, who brought about
a renewal of the truce for a year; and thus the aforesaid Prince of
Wales, having done much damage in Scotland, returned into England, and
the Scots dismissed their army."</p>

<p>Soon after his return from Scotland we find Henry with his father at
Gloucester,<a id="notetag226" name="notetag226"></a><a href="#note226">[226]</a>
where a Parliament was held in the beginning of
December; the records of which enable us to carry on still further the
testimony borne to the Prince's character by his contemporaries, and
to speak of an act of generosity and noble-mindedness placed beyond
the reach of calumny to disparage. The King, on the 1st of December
issued a commission for negociating a peace with France; alleging, as
the chief reason for hastening it, his desire to have more time and
leisure to appease the schism in the church. On the last day of their
sitting, the Parliament prayed the King to present the thanks of the
nation to the Prince of Wales for his great services; in answer to
which the King returned many thanks to the Commons. Immediately on
receiving this testimony of public gratitude, "the Prince fell down
upon his knees
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235">(p. 235)</a></span>
before the King, and very humbly mentioning
that he had heard of certain evil-intentioned obloquies and
detractions made to the slander of the Duke of
York,<a id="notetag227" name="notetag227"></a><a href="#note227">[227]</a>
declared
that, if it were not for the Duke's good advice and counsel, he, my
lord the Prince himself, and others in his company, would have been in
great peril and desolation." "Moreover," (continued the Prince,) "the
Duke, as though he had been one of the poorest gentlemen of the realm
who would have to toil and struggle for the acquirement of his own
honour and name, laboured, and did his very best to give courage and
comfort to all others around him. He affirmed also, that the Duke was
in everything a loyal and valiant
knight."<a id="notetag228" name="notetag228"></a><a href="#note228">[228]</a>
This generous conduct
towards one on whom the royal displeasure had fallen, but who seems to
have always conducted himself as a brave and faithful and honourable
subject, naturally raised in all who witnessed it a still higher
admiration of the character of the Prince, whose conduct had
repeatedly called for their grateful thanks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236">(p. 236)</a></span>
and warmest
eulogies. The Parliament would not separate without first praying the
King, that all who adhered steadily and faithfully to the Prince of
Wales might be encouraged and rewarded, and all who deserted him, and
left his company without his permission, might be punished.</p>

<p>The records of the year 1408 are particularly barren of facts with
regard either to the affairs of the kingdom at large, to the
state<a id="notetag229" name="notetag229"></a><a href="#note229">[229]</a>
of the Principality, or to the occupations and proceedings
of Henry of Monmouth. Shortly after Midsummer he was present as a
member of a council held in the church of St. Paul, when an indenture
of agreement between the King and his son, Thomas of Lancaster,
afterwards Duke of Clarence, was submitted to them for confirmation.
Besides the stipulated conditions on which the Lord Thomas should
engage to execute the office of Viceroy in Ireland, together with the
sources of his allowance and the mode of payment, this agreement
contains also a provision that the
Prince<a id="notetag230" name="notetag230"></a><a href="#note230">[230]</a>
should
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237">(p. 237)</a></span>
first
be paid what was assigned to him for the safeguard of Wales. The
record of this council concludes by adding, "And it was agreed by my
lord the Prince, and the other lords of the council, and by them
promised to the said Lord Thomas, that, as much as in them lay, the
assignments made to him, and specified in that indenture, should not
be revoked or stopped in any way." The closing paragraph of this
minute of the council is very important and interesting, especially in
one particular, presenting Henry of Monmouth to us under a new aspect:
it is the first instance in which we find the name of the Prince
mentioned by itself individually, in contradistinction to the other
members of the council; a practice for some time afterwards generally
observed.</p>

<p>Henry began at this time, in consequence, no doubt, of the requisition
of the council, to take a prominent part in the government of the
kingdom at large, and to enter upon that life of political activity
which gained for him the confidence and admiration of the great
majority of the people, whilst it exposed him to the envy and jealousy
of some individuals; yet he was not immediately released from the
cares and anxieties and expenses which the disturbed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238">(p. 238)</a></span>
state
of his Principality involved. For in the early part of the autumn of
this year we find him again present at
Caermarthen:<a id="notetag231" name="notetag231"></a><a href="#note231">[231]</a>
we have
reason, nevertheless, to believe that, when the winter closed in, he
quitted Wales, never to return to it again either as Prince or King.</p>

<p>After the Prince, however, had withdrawn from personally exerting
himself in the suppression of the insurgents, Owyn Glyndowr still
carried on a kind of desultory warfare, rallying from time to time his
scattered and dispirited adherents, heading them in predatory
incursions upon the property of his enemies, laying violent hands on
the persons of those who resisted his authority, and depriving them of
their liberty or their lives, as best suited his own views of policy.
On the 16th of May 1409, a mandate issued by the King at Westminster,
to Edward Charleton, Lord Powis, with
others,<a id="notetag232" name="notetag232"></a><a href="#note232">[232]</a>
is couched in
language which draws a frightful picture of the terror and confusion
and misery caused by these reckless rebels; conveying, nevertheless,
at the same time the idea of a lawless
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239">(p. 239)</a></span>
band of insurgents
resisting the authority of the government to the utmost of their
power, but no longer of an army headed by a sovereign and struggling
for independence. The preamble of the commission runs thus: "Whereas,
from the report of many, we understand that Owyn de Glyndowrdy, and
John,<a id="notetag233" name="notetag233"></a><a href="#note233">[233]</a>
who pretends that he is Bishop of St. Asaph, and other our
rebels and traitors in Wales, together with certain of our enemies of
France, Scotland, and other places, have now recently congregated
afresh, and gone about the lands of us, and of others our lieges, in
the same parts of Wales, day and night wickedly seizing upon some of
the said lands; and capturing, scourging, and imprisoning our faithful
lieges;
consuming,<a id="notetag234" name="notetag234"></a><a href="#note234">[234]</a>
carrying away, and devastating
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240">(p. 240)</a></span>
their
property, and committing many other enormities against our peace: We,
willing to resist the malice of the aforesaid Owyn, and the aforesaid
pretended Bishop, and to provide for the peace and repose of Wales,
give you this command."</p>

<p>Ten Welsh prisoners, under a warrant dated October 18th, were
delivered, as it is supposed for execution, by the Constable of
Windsor to William Lisle, Marshal of England. From this circumstance
some writers have inferred that a considerable engagement took place
this summer; but it may be doubted whether the measures adopted in
accordance with the above commission would not sufficiently account
for even a far greater number of prisoners being at the disposal of
the King: for he strictly charged all those lords and sheriffs to whom
his commission was directed "not to quit Wales till Owyn and the
pretended Bishop should be utterly routed, but to attack them with the
whole posse of the realm night and day." No doubt can be entertained
that both their duty and their interest would induce these persons to
put the King's mandate into execution promptly and vigorously; and
probably many of Owyn's partisans fell into
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241">(p. 241)</a></span>
the hands of the
government in the course of the present summer and autumn: Owyn
himself, also, either sued for a truce, or acceded to the proposals
made to him. The persons to whom the King delegated the duty of
crushing him, either influenced by a sense of the misery caused far
and wide by the depredations and havoc carried on by the Welsh rebels
on every side, or growing tired of a protracted struggle which brought
to them neither glory nor profit, made a truce with Owyn without any
warrant from the King. So far, however, was he from sanctioning their
proceeding that he annulled the truce altogether, and (November 23rd,
1409,) issued a new mandate to divers other persons to hasten with all
their powers against the rebels.</p>

<p>A curious legal document, of a date later by five years than the
circumstance to which it refers, informs us that the King, when
enumerating in his commission to Lord Powis the partisans of Owyn, in
addition to the auxiliaries of Scotland and France, might have
mentioned the malcontents also of England. Owyn's British supporters,
even at so late a period of his rebellion, were not confined to the
Principality, but were found in other parts of the kingdom. In Trinity
Term, 2 Henry V. (1414,) a presentation is found, recording this
curious fact: "John, Lord
Talbot,<a id="notetag235" name="notetag235"></a><a href="#note235">[235]</a>
(the Lord Furnivale,) was on
his road towards Caernarvon, there to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242">(p. 242)</a></span>
abide, and resist the
malice of Owyn Glyndowr and other rebels in the parts of Wales.
Accompanied by sixty men-at-arms and seven score archers, he was
hastening onward with all possible speed, in need of victuals, arms,
and other necessaries, intending to pass through Shrewsbury, and there
to buy them. On the Monday before the Nativity of John the Baptist,
(17th June,) in the tenth year of the late King, (1409,) one John
Weole, constable of the town and castle, and Richard Laken of Laken,
in the same county, Esquire, and others, with very many malefactors,
of premeditated malice closed the gates against them, and guarded
them, and would not suffer any of the King's lieges to come out and
assist them. By which Lord Furnivale and his men were much impeded,
and many of the King's commands remained
unexecuted."<a id="notetag236" name="notetag236"></a><a href="#note236">[236]</a></p>

<p>Of the rebellion in Wales, however, very few circumstances are
recorded after Henry of Monmouth had ceased to resist the rebels in
person: the war gradually dwindled, and sunk at last into
insignificance. A few embers of the conflagration still remained
unquenched, and called for the watchfulness of government; but the
flames had been so far subdued, that all sense of danger to the
general peace of the realm had been removed from the people of
England. No precise date can be assigned to the last show of
resistance on the part of Owyn or his followers. It must have been, at
all events, later
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243">(p. 243)</a></span>
than our historians have generally
supposed. About Christmas 1411 a free pardon was granted for all
treasons and crimes, with an exception from the King's grace of Owyn
Glyndowr himself, and one Thomas Trumpyngton, who seems to have made
himself very obnoxious to the government. In the same year payment was
made of various sums to defray the expenses of the late siege of
Harlech, the successful issue of which the record ascribes, to the
favour of God. In 1412 the King's licence was given to John Tiptoft,
seneschal, and William Boteler, receiver of Brecknock, to negociate
with Owyn for the ransom of David Gamne, the gallant Welshman who
afterwards fell at the battle of Agincourt. The licence was granted at
the suit of Llewellin ap Howell, David Gamne's father, and authorised
the parties to offer in exchange any Welshmen whom they could take
prisoners. In the same year, about Midsummer, the Pell Rolls,
recording a large sum paid to the Prince for the safeguard of Wales,
at the same time acquaint us with the waning state of the
insurrection; for the money was to enable the Prince to resist the
rebels "now seldom rising in
arms."<a id="notetag237" name="notetag237"></a><a href="#note237">[237]</a>
The same expression occurs in
the following December.</p>

<p>Still, though their rising was even then rare, yet as late as February
19, 1414, payment is registered of a sum "to a certain Welshman coming
to London, and continuing there, to give information concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244">(p. 244)</a></span>
the proceedings and designs of Ewain Glendowrdy."</p>

<p>We gladly bring to a close these references to the last days of the
dying rebellion in Wales, by recording an act of grace on the part of
Henry of
Monmouth.<a id="notetag238" name="notetag238"></a><a href="#note238">[238]</a>
It was after he had returned from his victory
at Agincourt, and when, notwithstanding the immense drain of men and
money in his campaign in Normandy, he could doubtless have extirpated
the whole remnant of the rebels, had he delighted in vengeance rather
than in mercy, that he commissioned Sir Gilbert Talbot to "communicate
and treat with Meredith ap Owyn, son of Owyn de Glendowrdy; and as
well the said Owyn, as other our rebels, to admit and receive into
their allegiance, if they seek it." Probably the stubborn heart of
Owyn scorned to sue for pardon, and to share the King's grace.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Of the last years of Owyn Glyndowr history furnishes us with very
scanty information. It is certain that he never fell into the hands of
his enemies: it is probable that, after having been compelled at
length to withdraw from the hopeless struggle in which he had
persevered with indomitable courage, he passed away in concealment his
few remaining years of disappointment and sorrow. Tradition ventures
to hint that friends in Herefordshire threw the shelter of their
hospitality over
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245">(p. 245)</a></span>
him in his days of distress and desolation.
But history returns no satisfactory answer to our inquiries whether he
was blessed with the consolations of religion in his calamity; nor
whether, to lighten the dreadful vicissitudes of his eventful life, he
was cheered at the close of his sorrow by any whom he loved. His
reverses brought with them no ordinary degree of suffering. In the
very opening of the rebellion his houses were burnt, and his lands
were confiscated. His brother fell in one of the earliest engagements
on the borders. In the course of the
struggle,<a id="notetag239" name="notetag239"></a><a href="#note239">[239]</a>
his wife and his
children, sons and daughters, were carried away captive, and retained
as prisoners. His friends were gone; many had fallen on the field of
battle; many had died under the hand of the executioner; many had
provided for their own safety by deserting him. Every act of grace and
pardon, though it embraced almost
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246">(p. 246)</a></span>
all besides, made an
exception of his name; till the above offer of mercy from Henry of
Monmouth included Owyn himself. His sufferings were enough in number
and intenseness to satisfy the vengeance of any one who was not
athirst for blood.</p>

<p>In estimating the character of this extraordinary man, we must
remember that almost the whole evidence which we have of him has been
derived through the medium of his enemies; in the next place, we must
not allow circumstances over which he had no control to darken his
fame; nor must our zeal in condemning the rebel, bury in oblivion the
patriot, though mistaken; or the hero, though unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Especially, then, must it be borne in mind, that not Henry Bolinbroke,
but Richard II. was the sovereign to whom
Glyndowr<a id="notetag240" name="notetag240"></a><a href="#note240">[240]</a>
had owed and
had originally sworn allegiance; that he had been especially and
confidentially employed in that unhappy monarch's immediate service;
that he was one of the very few who remained faithful to him, and
accompanied him through perils and trials to the last; and that he
left him only when Richard's misfortunes prohibited his friends from
giving him any longer assistance or comfort. We must remember also,
that, even had his master Richard been deposed or dead, it was not
Henry Bolinbroke, but the Earl of March, whom
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247">(p. 247)</a></span>
the laws of the
country had taught him to regard as his liege lord. We cannot, indeed,
in honesty assign to Glyndowr the crown of martyrdom won in his
country's cause; we cannot justly ascribe his career exclusively to
pure patriotism: there is too much of
self<a id="notetag241" name="notetag241"></a><a href="#note241">[241]</a>
mingled in his
character to justify us in enrolling him among the devoted friends of
freedom, and the disinterested enemies of tyranny. He was driven into
rebellion by the sense of individual injury and insult rather than of
his country's wrongs; and he too eagerly assumed to himself the
honours, authority, and power, as well as the title of sovereign of
his native land. But he was not one of those heartless ringleaders of
confusion,&mdash;he was not one of those desperate rebels with whom the
English too harshly and too rashly have been wont to number him. He
possessed many qualities of the hero, deserving a better cause and a
better fate. It is impossible not to admire his unconquerable courage,
his endurance of hardships, his faculty of making the very best of the
means within his reach, and his unshrinking perseverance as long as
there remained to him one ray of hope or one particle of strength. The
guilt of violated faith, though laid to his charge, has never been
established. He has been, moreover, often accused of cruelty, and of
engaging in savage warfare; but even his enemies and conquerors, by
their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248">(p. 248)</a></span>
actions and by their despatches, prove, that though
Owyn slew, and burnt, and laid waste far and wide, yet in all this he
executed only the law of retaliation, dreadful as that law is both in
its principle and in its consequences.</p>

<p>Owyn Glyndowr failed, and he was denounced as a rebel and a traitor.
But had the issue of the "sorry fight" of Shrewsbury been otherwise
than it was; had Hotspur so devised, and digested, and matured his
plan of operations, as to have enabled Owyn with his forces to join
heart and hand in that hard-fought field; had Bolinbroke and his
son<a id="notetag242" name="notetag242"></a><a href="#note242">[242]</a>
fallen on that fatal day;&mdash;instead of lingering among his
native mountains as a fugitive and a branded felon; bereft of his
lands, his friends, his children and his wife; waiting only for the
blow of death to terminate his earthly sufferings, and, when that blow
fell, leaving no
memorial<a id="notetag243" name="notetag243"></a><a href="#note243">[243]</a>
behind him to mark
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249">(p. 249)</a></span>
either the
time or the place of his release,&mdash;Owyn Glyndowr might have been
recognised even by England, as he actually had been by France, in the
character of an independent sovereign; and his people might have
celebrated his name as the avenger of his country's wrongs, the
scourge of her oppressors, and the restorer of her independence. The
anticipations of his own bard, Gryffydd Llydd, might have been amply
realized.<a id="notetag244" name="notetag244"></a><a href="#note244">[244]</a></p>

the obliging kindness of Sir Henry Ellis, the Author is
enabled to enrich his work by authentic representations of the Great
and Privy Seals of Owyn Glyndowr as Prince of Wales; he borrows at the
same time the clear and scientific description of them, with which
that antiquary furnished the
Archæologia.<a id="notetag245" name="notetag245"></a><a href="#note245">[245]</a>
The originals are
appended to two instruments preserved in the Hôtel Soubise at Paris,
both dated in the year 1404, and believed to relate to the furnishing
of the troops which were then supplied to Owyn by the King of France.</p>

<p>"On the obverse of the Great Seal, Owyn is represented with a bifid
beard, very similar to Richard II, seated under a canopy of Gothic
tracery; the half-body of a wolf forming the arms of his chair on each
side; the back-ground is ornamented with a mantle semée of lions, held
up by angels. At his feet are two lions. A sceptre is in his right
hand; but he has no crown. The inscription, OWENUS ... <span class="smcap">PRINCEPS
WALLIÆ</span>. On the reverse Owyn is represented on horseback in armour: in
his right hand, which is extended, he holds a sword; and with his
left, his shield charged with four lions rampant: a drapery, probably
a <i>kerchief de plesaunce</i>, or handkerchief won at a tournament,
pendent from the right wrist. Lions rampant also appear upon the
mantle of the horse. On his helmet, as well as on his horse's head, is
the Welsh dragon. The area of the seal is diapered with roses. The
inscription
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251">(p. 251)</a></span>
on this side seems to fill the gap upon the
obverse, <span class="smcap">OWENUS DEI GRATIA</span> ...
<span class="smcap">WALLIÆ</span>.</p>

<p>The Privy Seal represents the four lions rampant, towards the
spectator's left, on a shield, surmounted by an open coronet; the
dragon of Wales as a supporter on the dexter side, on the sinister a
lion. The inscription seems to have been <span class="smcap">SIGILLUM OWENI PRINCIPIS
WALLIÆ</span>.</p>

<p>No impression of this seal is probably now to be found either in Wales
or England. Its workmanship shows that Owyn Glyndowr possessed a taste
for art far beyond the types of the seals of his predecessors."</p>

1409-1412.</h3>


<p>Henry of Monmouth, whose years, from the earliest opening of youth to
the entrance of manhood, had chiefly been occupied within the
precincts of his own Principality in quelling the spirit of rebellion
which had burst forth there with great fury, and had been protracted
with a vitality almost incredible, is from this date to be viewed and
examined under a totally different combination of circumstances. Early
in the year 1409 he was appointed Warden of the Cinque Ports and
Constable of Dover for life, with a salary of 300<i>l.</i> a year. Thomas
Erpyngham, "the King's beloved and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253">(p. 253)</a></span>
faithful knight," who
held those offices by patent, having resigned them in favour of the
King's "very dear
son."<a id="notetag246" name="notetag246"></a><a href="#note246">[246]</a>
He was made on the 18th of March 1410,
Captain of Calais, by writ of privy seal; and he was constituted also
President of the King's Council.</p>

<p>The character of Henry having been assailed, not only in times distant
from our own, but by writers also of the present age, on the ground of
his having behaved towards his father with unkindness and cruelty
after the date of his appointment to these offices, it becomes
necessary, in order to ascertain the reality of the charge and its
extent, as well as the time to which his change of behaviour is to be
referred, to trace his footsteps in all his personal transactions with
his father, and in the management of the public affairs of the realm,
more narrowly than it might otherwise have been necessary or
interesting for us to do. Every incidental circumstance which can
throw any light on this uncertain and perplexing page of his history
becomes invested with an interest beyond its own intrinsic importance,
just as in a judicial investigation, where the animus of any party
bears upon the question at issue, the most minute and trifling
particular will often give a clue, whilst broad and striking events
may not assist in relieving the judge from any portion of his doubts.
On this principle the following facts are inserted here. They may
perhaps appear too
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254">(p. 254)</a></span>
disjointed for a continuous narrative;
and they are cited only as separate links which might form a chain of
evidence all bearing upon the question as to Henry's position from
this time with his father.</p>

<p>Early in the year 1409, the King, in a letter to the Pope, when
speaking of the Cardinal of Bourdeaux says, "He came into the presence
of us and of our first-born son, the Prince of Wales, and others, our
prelates." At this period we are informed by the dry details of the
royal exchequer, that the King was anxiously bent on the marriage of
his son. To Sir William Bourchier payment is made, (17th May 1409,) on
account of a voyage to Denmark and Norway, to treat with Isabella,
Queen of Denmark, for a marriage between the Lord Henry, Prince of
Wales, and the daughter of Philippa of Denmark; and on the 23rd of the
same
month<a id="notetag247" name="notetag247"></a><a href="#note247">[247]</a>
a payment is made to "Hugh Mortimer, Esq., lately
twice sent by the King's command to France, to enter into a contract
of marriage between the Prince and the second daughter of the King's
adversary, the King of France." In the August of 1409 the council
assembled at Westminster, resolved, with regard to Ireland, that,
should it be agreeable to the King and the Lord Thomas, it would be
expedient for Lord John Stanley to be appointed Lieutenant, he paying
a stipulated sum every year to the Lord Thomas. Before the council
broke up, the Prince, who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255">(p. 255)</a></span>
presided, undertook to speak on
this subject, as well to the King his father, as to his brother the
Lord Thomas. At this time it would appear that, so far from any
coldness, and jealousies, and suspicions existing between the Prince
and the members of his family, he was deemed the most fit person to
negociate an affair of much delicacy between the council and his
father and his brother.</p>

<p>On the 31st of January 1410, the King, in the palace of Lambeth,
"delivered the great seals to Thomas Beaufort, his brother, in the
presence of the Archbishop, Henry of York, and my lord the
Prince."<a id="notetag248" name="notetag248"></a><a href="#note248">[248]</a>
On the 5th of March following, the King's warrant was
signed for the burning of John Badley. The Prince's conduct on that
occasion, which has been strangely misrepresented, but which seems at
all events to testify to the kindness of his disposition, and his
anxiety to save a fellow-creature from suffering, is examined at some
length in another part of this work, where his character is
investigated with reference to the sweeping charge brought against him
of being a religious persecutor. On the 18th of that month, when he
was appointed Captain of Calais, his father at the same time made him
a present for life of his house called Coldharbour. It must be here
observed that the disagreement which evidently arose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256">(p. 256)</a></span>
and
continued for some time between the King and the Commons, though the
Prince was compelled to take a part in it, seems not to have shaken
the King's confidence in him, nor to have alienated his affections
from him at all. On the 23rd of March the Commons require the King to
appoint a council; and on Friday, the 2nd of May following, they ask
the King to inform them of the names of his council: on which occasion
this remarkable circumstance
occurred.<a id="notetag249" name="notetag249"></a><a href="#note249">[249]</a>
The King replied that many
had been excused; that the others were the Prince, the Bishops of
Worcester, Durham, and Bath, Lords Arundel, Westmoreland, and Burnell.
The Prince then, in the name of all, prayed to be excused, if there
would not be found money sufficient to defray the necessary charges;
and, should nothing adequate be granted, then that they should at the
end of the parliament be discharged from all expenses incurred by
them. Upon this they resolved that the Prince should not be sworn as a
member of the council, because of the high dignity of his honourable
person. The other members were sworn. It is to this stipulation of the
Prince that the King refers at the close of the parliament in 1411,
when, after the Commons had prayed the King to thank the Prince and
council, he says, "I am persuaded they would have done more had they
had more ample means, as my lord the Prince declared when they were
appointed."</p>

<p>It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page257" name="page257">(p. 257)</a></span>
has often been a subject of wonder what should have
brought the Prince and his brother so often into East-Cheap; and the
story of the Boar's Head in Shakspeare has long associated in our
minds Henry Prince of Wales with a low and vulgar part of London, in
which he could have had no engagement worthy of his station, and to
which, therefore, he must have resorted only for the purposes of riot
and revelry with his unworthy and dissolute companions. History
records nothing of the Prince derogatory to his princely and Christian
character during his residence in Coldharbour; it does indeed charge
two of the King's sons with a riot there, but they are stated by name
to be Thomas and John. Henry's name does not occur at all in connexion
with any disturbance or misdoing. The fact, however, (not generally
known,) of Henry having his own house, the gift of his father, in the
heart of London, near East-Cheap, (the scene indeed of Shakspeare's
poetical romance, but really the frequent place of meeting for the
King's council whilst Henry was their president,) might seem to call
for a few words as to the locality of Coldharbour and its
circumstances. The grant by his father of this mansion, dated
Westminster, March 18th, 1410, is couched in these words: "Know ye,
that, of our especial grace, we have granted to our dearest son, Henry
Prince of Wales, a certain hostel or place called Coldharbour, in our
city of London, with its appurtenances, to hold for the term
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258">(p. 258)</a></span>
of his life, without any payment to us for the
same."<a id="notetag250" name="notetag250"></a><a href="#note250">[250]</a>
These
premises, we learn, came into Henry IV.'s possession by the right of
his wife. Stowe, who supplies the materials from which we safely make
that inference, does not seem to have been aware that it was ever in
the possession of either that King or his son. He tells us it was
bought in the 8th of Edward III. by John Poultney, who was four times
mayor, and who lived there when it was called Poultney Inn. But,
thirteen years afterward (21 Edward III.), he, by charter, gave and
confirmed it to Humfrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Essex, as "his
whole tenement called Coldharbour, with all the tenements and key
adjoining, on the way called Haywharf Lane (All Saints ad f&oelig;num),
for a rose at Midsummer, if demanded. In 1397, John Holland, Earl of
Huntingdon, lodged there; and Richard II, his brother, dined with him.
It was then counted a right fair and stately
house."<a id="notetag251" name="notetag251"></a><a href="#note251">[251]</a></p>

<p>We are led to infer, though the formal grant of this house to Prince
Henry was made only in the March of this year, yet that it had been
his residence for some time previously; for, on the 8th of the
preceding February, we find a council held there, himself present as
its chief.</p>

<p>It does not appear by any positive statement that the Prince visited
Calais immediately on his appointment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259">(p. 259)</a></span>
to its captaincy, but
we shall probably be safe in concluding that he did so; for, very soon
afterwards, we find letters of
protection<a id="notetag252" name="notetag252"></a><a href="#note252">[252]</a>
for one year (from
April 23) given to Thomas Selby, who was to go with the Prince, and
remain with him at Calais. At all events, he was resident in London by
the middle of June, and had apparently engaged most actively in the
affairs of government. On the 16th of that month we find him president
at two sittings of the council on the same
day:<a id="notetag253" name="notetag253"></a><a href="#note253">[253]</a>
the first at
Coldharbour, in which it was determined that three parts of the
subsidy granted to the King on wools, hides, &amp;c. should be applied to
the payment of the garrison of Calais and of the marches thereof; the
second, at the Convent of the Preaching Friars, when an ordinance was
made for the payment of the garrison of Berwick and the East March of
Scotland.</p>

<p>The Prince presided at a council, on the 18th of June, in Westminster;
and, on the 19th, in the house of the Bishop of Hereford. To this
council his brother Thomas of Lancaster presented a petition praying
for reformation of certain tallies, by default of which he could not
obtain the money due to him. The preamble, as well as the body of this
petition, proves that at this time the Prince was regarded not merely
as a member of the council, but as its president, to be named and
addressed individually
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260">(p. 260)</a></span>
and in contradistinction to the other
members. "The petition of my lord Thomas of Lancaster, made to the
very honourable and puissant lord the Prince, and the other very
honourable and wise lords of the council of our sovereign lord the
King. First, may it please my said lord the Prince, and the other
lords of the council," &amp;c.&mdash;That up to this time no jealousy had
arisen in the King's mind in consequence of the growing popularity and
ascendency of his son, is evidenced by the record of the same council.
That document tells us plainly that the King was cordial with him, and
employed him as his confidential representative: it shall speak for
itself. "And then my said lord the Prince reported to the other
members of the council, that he had it in command from his very good
lord and father to ordain, with the advice of the others of the said
council, that the Lord Thomas Beaufort, brother of our said lord the
King and his chancellor of England, should have such gratuity for one
year beyond his fees as to them should seem reasonable. On which, by
our said lord the Prince, and all the others, it was agreed that the
said chancellor should receive for one year, from the day of his
appointment, 800 marks."</p>

<p>The next council, at which also we find the Prince acting as
president, was held on the 11th of July. Between the dates of these
two last councils, that disturbance in the street took place which the
Chronicle of London refers to merely as "an affray
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261">(p. 261)</a></span>
in
East-Cheap between the townsmen and the Princes Thomas and John;" but
which Stowe records with much of detail and minuteness. Many, it is
believed, may be disposed to regard it as the foundation chosen by
Shakspeare on which to build the superstructure of his own fascinating
imagination, and on which other writers more grave, though not more
trustworthy as historians, have rested for conclusive evidence of the
wild frolics and "madcap" adventures of Henry of Monmouth. Stowe's
account is this: "In the year 1410, upon the eve of St. John the
Baptist, (i.e. June 23,) the King's sons, Thomas and John, being in
East-Cheap at supper, or rather at breakfast, (for it was after the
watch was broken up, betwixt two and three of the clock after
midnight,) a great debate happened between their men and other of the
court, which lasted an hour, even till the mayor and sheriffs, with
other citizens, appeased the same: for the which afterwards the said
mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs were sent for to answer before the King;
his sons and divers lords being highly moved against the city. At
which time, William Gascoigne, chief justice, required the mayor and
aldermen, for the citizens, to put them in the King's
grace.<a id="notetag254" name="notetag254"></a><a href="#note254">[254]</a>
Whereunto they answered that they had not offended, but according to
the law had done their best in stinting debate and maintaining of the
peace: upon which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262">(p. 262)</a></span>
answer the King remitted all his ire and
dismissed them." It must be observed that not one word is here said of
Prince Henry having anything whatever to do with the affray: whether
"other of the court" meant some of his household, or not, does not
appear; neither are we told that the two brothers had been supping
with the Prince. And yet, unless some facts are alleged by which the
mayor and the chief justice may be connected with him in reference to
some broil, we may well question whether the current stories relating
to his East-Cheap revelries have any other foundation than this. At
all events, the Prince seems to have been most regular during this
summer in his attendance at the council-board. On the 22nd, 29th, 30th
of July, we find him acting as president. The last council was held at
the house of Robert Lovell, Esq. near Old Fish Street in London; at
which 1400<i>l.</i> was voted to the Prince for the safeguard of Calais, to
be repaid out of the first receipts from the duties on wools and
skins.<a id="notetag255" name="notetag255"></a><a href="#note255">[255]</a></p>

<p>On the 18th of November we find a mandate directed to the Prince, as
Warden of the Cinque Ports, to see justice done in a case of piracy;
and on the 29th, the King, being then at Leicester, issues to Henry
the Prince, as Captain of Calais, and to his lieutenant, the same
commission, to grant safe-conducts,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263">(p. 263)</a></span>
as had been given to
John Earl of Somerset, the late
captain.<a id="notetag256" name="notetag256"></a><a href="#note256">[256]</a></p>

<p>Where the Prince passed the winter does not seem to be recorded. In
the following spring we find this minute of council. "Be it
remembered, that on Thursday, the 19th of March, in the twelfth year
of our sovereign lord the King, at Lambeth, in presence of our said
lord the King, and his very dear son my lord the Prince, the following
prelates and other lords were
assembled."<a id="notetag257" name="notetag257"></a><a href="#note257">[257]</a>
It cannot escape
observation, that, instead of the Prince being mentioned as one of the
council, or as their president, his name is coupled with the King's as
one of the two in whose presence the others were
assembled.<a id="notetag258" name="notetag258"></a><a href="#note258">[258]</a></p>

<p>Early
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264">(p. 264)</a></span>
in the autumn of this year a negociation was set on
foot for a marriage between Prince Henry and the daughter of the Duke
of Burgundy. Ambassadors were appointed for carrying on the treaty;
and on September 1st, 1411, instructions were given to the Bishop of
St. David's, the Earl of Arundel, Lord Francis de Court, Hugh
Mortimer, Esq. and John Catryk, Clerk, or any two or more of them, how
to negociate without finally concluding the treaty, and to report to
the King and Prince.</p>

<p>The instructions may be examined at full length in Sir Harris Nicolas'
"Acts of the Privy Council" by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265">(p. 265)</a></span>
any who may feel an interest
in them independently of Henry of Monmouth's character and
proceedings; to others the first paragraph will sufficiently indicate
the tenour of the whole document. "First, inasmuch as our sovereign
lord the King, by the report of the message of the Duke of Burgundy,
understood that the Duke entertains a great affection and desire to
have an alliance with our said sovereign by means of a marriage to be
contracted, God willing, between our redoubted lord the Prince and the
daughter of the aforesaid Duke, the King wishes that his said
ambassadors should first of all demand of the Duke his daughter, to be
given to my lord the Prince; and that after they have heard what the
Duke will offer on account of the said marriage, whether by grant of
lands and possessions, or of goods and jewels, and according to the
greatest offer which by this negociation might be made by one party or
the other, a report be made of that to our said lord the King and our
said lord the Prince by the ambassadors." The other instructions
relate rather to political stipulations than pecuniary arrangements.
These negociations met with the fate they merited; and all idea of a
marriage between the Prince and the daughter of the Duke of Burgundy
was abandoned. But since Henry's behaviour in the transaction has been
urged as proof of his having then discarded parental authority, and
acted for himself in contravention of his father's wishes, thereby
incurring his royal displeasure,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266">(p. 266)</a></span>
and sowing the seeds of
that state of mutual dissatisfaction, and jealousy, and strife which
is said to have grown up afterwards into a harvest of bitterness, the
subject assumes greater importance to those who are anxiously tracing
Henry's real character; and must be examined and sifted with care, and
patience, and candour.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>The question involved is this: "In the quarrel between the Dukes of
Burgundy and Orleans, did Prince Henry send the first troops from his
own forces under the command of his own friends to the aid of the Duke
of Burgundy, against the express wishes of his father; or did the
contradictory measures of England in first succouring the Duke of
Burgundy, and then the Duke of Orleans his antagonist, arise from a
change of policy in the King himself and the English government,
without implying undutiful conduct on the part of the Prince, or
dissatisfaction in his father towards him?" The former view has been
recommended for adoption, though it reflects upon the Prince's
character as a son; and it has been thereupon suggested that, "instead
of denying his previous faults, we should recollect his sudden and
earnest reformation, and the new direction of his feelings and
character, as the mode more beneficial to his
memory."<a id="notetag259" name="notetag259"></a><a href="#note259">[259]</a>
But in
this work, which professes not to search for exculpation, nor to deal
in eulogy, but to seek the truth, and follow it to whatever
consequences
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267">(p. 267)</a></span>
it might lead, we must on no account so hastily
acquiesce in the assumption that Henry of Monmouth was on this
occasion undutifully opposed to his
father.<a id="notetag260" name="notetag260"></a><a href="#note260">[260]</a>
However rejoiced we
may be to find in a fellow-Christian the example of a sincere penitent
growing in grace, it cannot be right to multiply or aggravate his
faults for the purpose of making his conversion more striking and
complete. We may firmly hope that, if he had been a disobedient and
unkind son in any one particular, he repented truly of that fault. But
his biographer must sift the evidence adduced in proof of the alleged
delinquency; instead of admitting on insufficient ground an
allegation, in order to assimilate his character to general fame, or
to heighten the dramatic effect of his subsequent course of virtue.</p>

<p>In discussing this question it will be necessary to attend with care
to the order and date of each circumstance. By a temporary
forgetfulness of this indispensable part of an historian's duty, the
writers who have adopted the view most adverse to Henry as a son, have
been led to give an incorrect view of the whole transaction,
especially as it affects the character and filial conduct of the
Prince.</p>

<p>The first application for aid was made to the King by the Duke of
Burgundy, who offered at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268">(p. 268)</a></span>
time his daughter in
marriage to the Prince. This was in August 1411; and doubtless, if he
found the King backward or unfavourably inclined, he would naturally
apply to the Prince for his good offices, who was personally most
interested in the result of the negociation; not to induce him to act
against his father, but to prevail upon his father to agree to the
proposal. This course was, we are told, actually pursued, and Prince
Henry was allowed by his father to send some forces immediately to
strengthen the ranks of Burgundy. They joined his army, and remained
at Paris till provisions became so dear that they resolved to procure
them from the enemy, who were stationed at St. Cloud. Here, at the
broken bridge, the two parties engaged; and Burgundy, by the help of
the English auxiliaries, completely routed the Duke of Orleans'
forces. The English subsequently received their pay; and, their
services being no longer required, returned at their leisure by Calais
to their own country. The Duke of Orleans learning that these troops
were dismissed unceremoniously by his antagonist, and conceiving that
Henry's resentment of the indignity might make for him a favourable
opening, despatched ambassadors to England with most magnificent
offers; but this was not till the beginning of the next year after the
battle of St. Cloud, which took
place<a id="notetag261" name="notetag261"></a><a href="#note261">[261]</a>
on the 10th November 1411.
That the King himself contemplated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269">(p. 269)</a></span>
the expediency of sending
auxiliaries to the Duke of Burgundy in the beginning of September, is
put beyond doubt by the instructions given to the ambassadors. Even so
late as February 10, 1412, the King issued a commission to Lord Grey,
the Bishop of Durham, and others, not only to treat for the marriage
of the Prince with that Duke's daughter, but to negociate with him
also on mutual alliances and confederacies, and on the course of trade
between England and Flanders; the King having previously, on the 11th
of January, signed letters patent, to remain in force till the Feast
of Pentecost, for the safe conduct and protection of the Duke's
ambassadors with one hundred men. With a view of enabling the reader
more satisfactorily to form his own judgment on the validity of this
charge of unfilial and selfwilled conduct on the part of Henry of
Monmouth, the Author is induced, instead of confining himself to the
general statement of his own views, or of the considerations on which
his conclusion has been built, to cite the evidence separately of
several authors who have recorded the proceedings. He trusts the
importance of the point at issue will be thought to justify the
detail.</p>

<p>Walsingham, who is in some points very minute when describing these
transactions, so as even to record the very words employed by the King
on the first application of the Duke, does not mention the name of the
Prince of Wales throughout. He represents the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270">(p. 270)</a></span>
King as having
recommended the Duke to try measures of mutual forgiveness and
reconciliation; at all events, to let the fault of encouraging civil
discord be with his adversaries; but withal promising, in case of the
failure of that plan, to send the aid he desired. The same writer
states the mission of the Earl of Arundel, Lord Kyme, Lord Cobham,
(Sir John Oldcastle,) and others, with an army, as the consequence of
this engagement on the part of the
King.<a id="notetag262" name="notetag262"></a><a href="#note262">[262]</a>
He then tells us that,
in the next year after these forces had been dismissed by the Duke of
Burgundy, the Duke of Orleans made application to the King.</p>

<p>Elmham, who mentions the successful application of Burgundy to the
Prince, and the consequent mission of an English force, represents the
Prince as having recommended himself more than ever to his royal
father on that
occasion.<a id="notetag263" name="notetag263"></a><a href="#note263">[263]</a></p>

<p>Titus Livius, who says that the Duke of Burgundy applied to the
Prince, and that he sent some of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271">(p. 271)</a></span>
his own men to succour him,
distinctly tells us that he did it with the good-will and consent of
his father. He adds, (what could have originated only in an oversight
of dates,) that the Prince was made, in consequence of his conduct on
this occasion, the chief of the council, and was always called the
dear and beloved son of his father. He intimates, (but very
obscurely,) that, by the aspersions of some, his fame sustained for a
short time some blemish in this
point.<a id="notetag264" name="notetag264"></a><a href="#note264">[264]</a></p>

<p>Polydore
Vergil<a id="notetag265" name="notetag265"></a><a href="#note265">[265]</a>
says distinctly that, on the Duke of Burgundy
first opening the negociation, the King, anticipating good to himself
from the quarrels of his neighbours, willingly promised aid, and as
soon as possible sent a strong force to succour him. He then records
the victory gained by Burgundy at the Bridge of St. Cloud, and the
dismissal of his English allies with presents; adding, that King Henry
thought it a weakness in him to send them home prematurely, before he
had finished the struggle. And
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272">(p. 272)</a></span>
when the Duke of Orleans, on
hearing of this hasty dismissal, entered upon a counter negociation,
the King willingly listened to his proposals, having felt hurt at the
conduct of the Duke of Burgundy towards those English auxiliaries.</p>

<p>The Chronicle of London tells us that, when the King would grant no
men to the Duke of Burgundy, he applied to the Prince, "who sent the
Earl of Arundel and the Lord Cobham, with other lords and gentles,
with a fair retinue and well-arrayed people."</p>

<p>Whilst we remark that in these several accounts no allusion whatever
is made to any opposition to his father on the part of the Prince, or
any sign of displeasure on the part of the King in this particular
point of his conduct, the simple facts are decidedly against the
supposition of any such unsatisfactory proceeding. In February 1412,
more than three months after the Earl of Arundel's dismissal by the
Duke of Burgundy, the King was still engaged in negociations with that
Duke: nor was it till three months after that,&mdash;not till May
18th,&mdash;that the final treaty between the King and the Duke of Orleans
was signed.<a id="notetag266" name="notetag266"></a><a href="#note266">[266]</a>
And it is very remarkable that, within two days, the
Prince<a id="notetag267" name="notetag267"></a><a href="#note267">[267]</a>
himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273">(p. 273)</a></span>
as well as his three brothers, in the
presence of their father, solemnly undertook to be parties to that
treaty, and to abide faithfully by its provisions.</p>

<p>We are compelled, then, to infer, that there is no evidence whatever
of Prince Henry having acted in this affair in contravention of his
father's will. He very probably used his influence to persuade the
King, and was successful. And as to the application having been made
to him by the Duke of Burgundy, and not to the King, we must bear in
mind that, at this period, it was to him that even his brother Thomas
presented his petition, and not to his father; and that the Pope sent
his commendatory letters to him, and not to the
King.<a id="notetag268" name="notetag268"></a><a href="#note268">[268]</a></p>

<p>The French historians, though their attention has naturally been drawn
to the introduction of English auxiliaries into the land of France,
rather than to the authority by which they were commissioned, enable
us to acquiesce with increased satisfaction in the conclusion to which
we have arrived. Whether contemporary or
modern,<a id="notetag269" name="notetag269"></a><a href="#note269">[269]</a>
they seem all to
have considered the original mission of Lord Arundel and the troops
under his command as the act of King Henry IV.
himself.<a id="notetag270" name="notetag270"></a><a href="#note270">[270]</a>
They
inform us, moreover, that,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page274" name="page274">(p. 274)</a></span>
on the arrival in England of the
subsequent embassy of the Duke of Burgundy, so late as March
1412,<a id="notetag271" name="notetag271"></a><a href="#note271">[271]</a>
his representatives were received with every mark of
respect and cordiality, not only by the Prince, but by the King also,
and his other sons. They lead us also to infer that, when the
confederate French princes made their application for succours "to the
King and his second
son,"<a id="notetag272" name="notetag272"></a><a href="#note272">[272]</a>
the Prince withheld his concurrence
from the change of conduct adopted by his father, and endeavoured to
the utmost of his power to prevent the contemplated expedition under
the Duke of Clarence from being carried into effect. A comparison of
these authors with our own undisputed documents supplies a very
intelligible and consistent view of the whole transaction; and so far
from representing Henry of Monmouth as an undutiful son, obstinately
bent on pursuing his own career, reckless of his father's wishes,
bears incidental testimony both to his steadiness of purpose, and to
his unwillingness to act in opposition to his father. In conjunction
with the King he originally espoused the cause of Burgundy, and was
afterwards averse from deserting their ally. He was anxious also to
dissuade his father from adopting that vacillating policy on which he
saw him bent. But within two days after the King had irrevocably taken
his final resolve, and had joined himself to the Duke of Orleans, and
the other confederated princes by a league, offensive and defensive,
against
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275">(p. 275)</a></span>
the Duke of Burgundy, instead of persevering in his
opposition to that measure, or defying his father's authority, within
two days he made himself a party to that league, and pledged his faith
to observe it.</p>

<p>Although Prince Henry seems to have had little to do with these
continental expeditions beyond the first mission of Lord Arundel and
his forces, yet it is impossible not to suspect (as the French at the
time anticipated) that this decided interference, on the part of
England, with the affairs of France, may have been a prelude to the
enterprise of the next reign. Who can say that the battle and victory
at St. Cloud passed away without any influence on the course of events
which made Henry V. heir to the King of France?</p>

<p>We must not leave the mention of this battle without repeating the
testimony borne by the chroniclers of the day to the courage and
humanity of the English, though we lament, at the same time, the act
of cruelty on the part of the French, with which the character of our
forefathers stands in such strong contrast. When the victory was won,
the Duke of Burgundy, with the usual ferocity of civil warfare,
commanded his officers to put their prisoners to death. The English
generals resisted this sanguinary
mandate,<a id="notetag273" name="notetag273"></a><a href="#note273">[273]</a>
declaring they would
die with their captives
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276">(p. 276)</a></span>
rather than see them murdered; at the
same time forming their men in battle-array to support, with their
lives, their noble resolution.</p>

<p>It was about the Feast of the Assumption (August 25) that the King
sent his son Thomas Duke of
Clarence<a id="notetag274" name="notetag274"></a><a href="#note274">[274]</a>
to aid the Duke of Orleans
against the Duke of Burgundy: "many persons," says Walsingham,
"wondering what could be the sudden change, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277">(p. 277)</a></span>
in so short
a space of time the English should support two opposite contending
parties." The Duke of Orleans failed to join them in time, and the
English committed many depredations as in an enemy's country. At last,
the two generals meeting, the Duke of Orleans consented to pay a large
sum to the Duke of Clarence on condition that the English should
evacuate the country: and the Earl of
Angouleme<a id="notetag275" name="notetag275"></a><a href="#note275">[275]</a>
was given as a
hostage for the due payment of the stipulated sum. The Duke of
Clarence did not return to England till after his father's death.</p>


<span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278">(p. 278)</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">unfounded charge against henry of peculation. &mdash; still more serious
accusation of a cruel attempt to dethrone his diseased father. &mdash; the
question fully examined. &mdash; probably a serious though temporary
misunderstanding at this time between the king and his son. &mdash; henry's
conduct filial, open, and merciful. &mdash; the "chamber" or the "crown
scene." &mdash; death of henry the fourth.</span><br><br>

1412-1413.</h3>


<p>Two other accusations brought against the fair fame of Henry of
Monmouth in reference to his conduct in the very year before his
accession to the throne, must be now carefully weighed. The first,
indeed, is fully refuted by the selfsame page of our records which
contains it: the second, unless some new light could be thrown upon
this dark and mysterious page of his life, can scarcely have failed to
make an unfavourable impression on the minds of every one whose heart
has ever felt the bond of filial duty and affection.</p>

<p>With regard to the first accusation, we cannot do better than quote
the words of the antiquary who has first brought both the calumnious
charge and its refutation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279">(p. 279)</a></span>
to light. "The general impression
(says that writer) which exists respecting the character of Henry V,
and especially whilst Prince of Wales, is so opposed to the idea that
he could possibly be suspected of a pecuniary fraud, that it excites
surprise that he should have been accused of appropriating to his own
use the money which he had received for the payment of his soldiers.
In the Minutes of the Council, between July and September 1412, the
following entry occurs: 'Because my lord the Prince, Captain of the
town of Calais, is slandered in the said town and elsewhere, that he
should have received many large sums of money for the payment of his
soldiers, and that those sums have not been distributed among them,
the contrary is proved by two rolls of paper being in the council, and
sent by my said lord the Prince; it is ordered that letters be issued
under the privy seal, explanatory of the fact respecting the Prince in
that matter.'"</p>

<p>Although it may excite our wonder that the character of Henry of
Monmouth should have been assailed for appropriating to other purposes
money received for the payment of his troops, yet such an acquaintance
with the exhausted state of the treasury of England at that day, as
even these pages afford, will diminish the
surprise.<a id="notetag276" name="notetag276"></a><a href="#note276">[276]</a>
The
probability is,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280">(p. 280)</a></span>
that, of the "large sums" voted by
parliament, a very small proportion only was immediately forthcoming;
and that, as in Wales, so in Calais, he could with great difficulty
gather from that exhausted source enough from time to time to keep his
men together. Persons not acquainted with this fact, hearing of the
large sums voted, might naturally suspect that there was not
altogether fair and upright dealing. However, the above extract is the
only document known on the subject; and the same sentence which
records the "slander," contains also his acquittal. He had forwarded
his debtor and creditor account in two rolls, and by them it was
proved that the slander was unfounded; and a writ of privy seal
declaring his innocence was immediately issued. The fact is, that, at
that very time, there was due to the Prince for Calais no less a sum
than 8689<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i>; besides the sum of 1200<i>l.</i> due for the wages of
sixty men-at-arms and one hundred and twenty archers, who were still
living at Kymmere and Bala for the safeguard of Wales; whilst the
council at the same time declared, that they knew not how to raise the
money for the wages of the men who were with the Prince. The affairs
of Calais seem to have fallen into some confusion before the Prince
was appointed Captain, as the Minutes of Council speak of the ancient
debts incurred whilst the Earl of Somerset was captain, as well as the
more recent expenses; and record that Robert Thorley, the treasurer,
and Richard Clitherowe, victualler,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281">(p. 281)</a></span>
were charged to come,
with their accounts written out, on the morrow of All Souls next
ensuing, specifying the persons to whom the several sums were paid,
and the dates of payment. The King, also, in a council at Merton, on
October 21st, orders certain changes to be made in the mode of
collecting the duties on skins and wools; "to the intent that my lord
the Prince, as Captain of the town of Calais, may the more readily
receive payment of the arrears due to him and his soldiers, living
there for the safeguard of the said town." We have seen that, in
Wales, the Prince was driven by necessity to pawn the few jewels in
his possession, in order to pay the soldiers under him; and, as
Captain of Calais, he appears to have had a great difficulty in
obtaining payment of the sums assigned to
him.<a id="notetag277" name="notetag277"></a><a href="#note277">[277]</a>
No one can any
longer wonder that the soldiers were not paid, or that their
complaints should offer themselves in the form of accusation. The
Prince stands entirely free from blame, and clear of all suspicion of
misdoing.</p>

<p>Though these causes are of themselves more than enough to account for
the depressed state of Henry of Monmouth's finances; yet there was
another drain, the pecuniary difficulties of his father, which, though
hitherto unnoticed, must not be suppressed in these Memoirs.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282">(p. 282)</a></span>
It is not necessary more than to refer to the causes of the pecuniary
difficulties of Henry IV; as the public and authentic documents of his
reign suggest a suspicion of want of economy in his more domestic
expenditure, and leave no doubt as to the extent to which he
endeavoured to meet his increasing wants by loans from spiritual and
municipal bodies, as well as from individuals. Among others, his son
Henry's name occurs, not once or twice, but repeatedly. Whilst some
loans, with reference to the then value of money, must be considered
large; others cannot fail to excite surprise from the smallness of
their
amount.<a id="notetag278" name="notetag278"></a><a href="#note278">[278]</a></p>

<p class="p2">

<p>A charge, however, more vitally affecting Henry's character than any
other by which it has ever been assailed, requires now a patient and
thorough investigation. The groundwork, indeed, upon which the
accusation is built, is of great antiquity, though the superstructure
is of very recent date. Were it sufficient for a biographer, who would
deal uprightly, merely to contradict the evidence by demonstrating its
inconsistency with indisputable facts, the business of refutation in
this instance would be brief, as the accusation breaks down in every
particular, from whatever point of view we may examine it. But the
province of these Memoirs must not be so confined. To establish the
truth in these points satisfactorily, as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283">(p. 283)</a></span>
to place
clearly before the mind the total inadequacy of the evidence to
substantiate the charge, will require a more full and detailed
examination of the value of the Manuscript on which the charge is made
to rest, than could be conveniently introduced into the body of this
narrative. The whole is therefore reserved for the Appendix; and to a
careful, dispassionate weighing of the arguments there adduced, the
reader is earnestly invited.</p>

<p>But the Author, as he has above intimated, does not think his duty
would be performed were he merely to prove that the charge against
Henry is altogether untenable upon the evidence adduced; though that
is all which the accusation so unsparingly now in these late years
brought against him requires or deserves. The very allusion to such an
offence as undutiful, unfilial conduct in one whose life is otherwise
an example of obedience, respect, and affection towards his father,
requires the biographer to take up the province of inquisitor, and
ascertain what ground there may be, independently of that inadequate
evidence alleged by others, for believing Henry to have once at least,
and for a time, forgotten the duties of a son; or what proceedings,
not involving his guilt, might have given rise to the unfounded
rumour, and of what satisfactory explanation they may admit.</p>

<p>The charge is this: That, in the parliament held in November 1411,
Prince Henry desired of his father the resignation of his crown, on
the plea that the malady
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284">(p. 284)</a></span>
under which the King was suffering
would not allow him to rule any longer for the honour and welfare of
the kingdom. On the King's firm and peremptory refusal, the Prince,
greatly offended, withdrew from the court, and formed an overwhelming
party of his own among the nobility and gentry of the land,
"associating them to his dominion in homage and pay." Such is the
statement made (not indeed in the form of an accusation, but merely as
one of the occurrences of the year,) in the manuscript above referred
to. The modern comment upon this text would probably never have been
made, if the writer had given more time and patient investigation to
the subject; and now, were such a suppression compatible with the
thorough sifting of Henry's character and conduct, the quotation of it
might well have been spared in these pages. A few words, however, on
that comment, and recently renewed charge, seem indispensable. "The
King's subsequent death (such are the words of the modern historian)
prevented the final explosion of this unfilial conduct, which, as thus
stated, deserves the denomination of an unnatural rebellion; and shows
that the dissolute companion of Falstaff was not the gay and
thoughtless youth which his dramatic representation exhibits to us,
but that, amid his vicious gaieties, he could cherish feelings which
too much resemble the unprincipled ambition of a Catilinarian
temper."<a id="notetag279" name="notetag279"></a><a href="#note279">[279]</a></p>

<p>These are hard words; and, if deserved, must condemn Henry of
Monmouth. That they are not deserved;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285">(p. 285)</a></span>
that he was not guilty
of this offence against God and his father; that the page which
records it condemns itself, and is contradictory to our undisputed
public records; that the manuscript which contains the charge carries
with it no authority whatever; and that the inference which has lately
been fastened upon the original report is altogether inconsistent with
the acknowledged facts of the case, are points which the Author
believes he has established beyond further controversy in the
Appendix; and to that dissertation he again with confidence refers the
reader. But every reader whose verdict is worth receiving, will agree
that our abhorrence of a crime should only increase our care and
circumspection that no innocent person stand charged with it. If Henry
were guilty, his character must remain branded with an indelible
stain, in the estimation of every parent and every child, incomparably
more disgraceful than those "vicious gaieties" with which poets and
historiographers have delighted to stamp his memory.&mdash;At a time when
disease was paralysing all a father's powers of body and mind, and
hurrying him prematurely to the grave, that a first-born son, instead
of devoting himself, and all his heart, and all his faculties, to his
parent; strengthening his feeble hands, supporting his faltering
steps, guiding his erring counsels, bearing his heavy burden,
protecting him from the machinations of the malicious and designing,
cheering his drooping spirits, making (as far
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286">(p. 286)</a></span>
as in him lay)
his last days on earth days of peace, and comfort, and calm
preparation for the change to which he was hastening;&mdash;instead of
this, that a son, who had always professed respect and affection for
his father, should thrust the most painful thorn of all into the side
of a sinking, broken down, dying man, is so abhorrent from every
feeling, not only of a truly noble and generous spirit, but of mere
ordinary humanity,&mdash;is so utterly "unprincipled," "unfilial," and
"unnatural,"&mdash;that though in such a case we might hope, after a life
of sincere Christian penitence, the stain might have been removed from
his conscience; yet, in the estimation of the wise and good, he could
never have obtained the name of "the most excellent and most gracious
flower of Christian chivalry."</p>

<p>Although for the real merits of the question, as far as relates to the
manuscript, we refer to the argument in the Appendix; and although, if
the foundation of original documents be withdrawn, it matters little
to the investigator of the truth what superstructure modern writers
have hastily run up; yet such a positive assertion as that "the King's
subsequent death prevented the final explosion of this unfilial
conduct and unnatural rebellion" of the Prince, who cherished
"feelings resembling the unprincipled ambition of a Catilinarian
temper," does seem to call for a few words before we proceed with the
narrative. It is difficult to say whether the confused views of the
manuscript,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287">(p. 287)</a></span>
or of its modern commentator, be the greater.
The manuscript, (to mention here only one specimen of its confusion,)
in the very page which contains the accusing passage, represents the
expedition to France in the summer of 1411; the battle of St. Cloud,
which was fought November 10, of the same year; the expedition under
the Duke of Clarence, which was undertaken after Midsummer 1412; and
the return of the Duke and his forces to England, which was not till
the spring of 1413, as having all taken place in the thirteenth year
of Henry IV. And the commentator who tells us that the King's death
prevented the final explosion of Henry's unfilial conduct, by
confounding (as the manuscript had also done) the parliament in
November 1411, with the parliament in February 1413, has entirely
overlooked the facts which give a direct contradiction to his
statement. The King's death did not occur till March 1413, more than a
year and a quarter after the parliament ended in which the Prince is
said to have been guilty of this act. The session of that parliament
began on the 3rd of November, and broke up on the 20th of December;
and the King, nearly half a year after its dissolution, declares his
fixed<a id="notetag280" name="notetag280"></a><a href="#note280">[280]</a>
purpose, in order to avoid the spilling of human blood, to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288">(p. 288)</a></span>
go in his own person to the Duchy of Guienne, and vindicate
his rights with all possible
speed."<a id="notetag281" name="notetag281"></a><a href="#note281">[281]</a>
Surely the web of his
father's life left Henry no lack of time and opportunity for the
execution of any measures which the most reckless ambition could
devise, or the most "Catilinarian" temper sanction. But, leaving this
ill-advised statement without further observation, it remains for us
to proceed with our narrative, entirely free from any apprehensions or
misgivings that our researches and reflections may tend only to
elucidate the character of one who, in the midst of splendid sins,
would sacrifice his own father to unbounded, reckless ambition, and
unprincipled self-aggrandizement.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Henry of Monmouth had now for a long time been virtually in possession
of the royal authority. He was not only President of the Council, but
his name is united with the King's when both are present; and
everything seems to have proceeded smoothly, with the best feelings of
mutual confidence and kindness between himself, his father, and his
brothers. Whether the King's own inclination, uninfluenced by the
representations of his parliament, would have led him to put the reins
of government
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289">(p. 289)</a></span>
into his son's hand, or whether he was induced
by the complaints and urgent suggestions of the council (of which many
broad and deep vestiges remain on record) to transfer the executive
and legislative functions of the royal prerogative to a son in whom
the people had entire confidence, may admit of much doubt. Probably
both causes, his own increasing infirmities, and his people's
dissatisfaction at the mismanagement of the court, expressed in no
covert language, co-operated in producing that result. Hardyng (as he
first wrote on this subject) would lead us to adopt the former view:</p>

<p class="poem">
"The King fell sick then, each day more and more;<br>
 Wherefore the Prince <i>he</i> made (as it was seen)<br>
 Chief of Council, to ease him of his sore;<br>
 Who to the Duke of Burgoyne sent, I ween;"</p>

<p>whilst the petitions presented to him, and some subsequent events
which must hereafter be noticed, make us suspect that the behaviour of
the Commons might have hastened his resolution.</p>

<p>At the close of the year, (from recounting the transactions of which
this serious charge against Henry's character induced us to digress,)
the parliament met in the first week in November. It was to have been
opened on the morrow of All Souls, (November 3, 1411,) but the peers
and commoners were so tardy in their arrival, that the King postponed
his meeting the parliament till the next day. In those times, the
monarch seems to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290">(p. 290)</a></span>
in the habit of attending the
parliamentary deliberations, and receiving the petitions, and taking
part generally in the proceedings in person. Through this session
Henry IV. was repeatedly present; and the Prince alone, of all his
sons, appears to have attended also. Towards the close of this
parliament, (the very parliament in which the alleged unfilial conduct
of the Prince is represented to have occurred,) proceedings are
recorded, which, though referred to in the Appendix for the sake of
the argument, seem to require notice here also in the way of
narration.</p>

<p>"Also, on Monday the last day of November, the said Speaker, in the
name of the Commons, prayed the King to thank my lord the Prince, the
Bishops of Winchester, of Durham, and others, who were assigned by the
King to be of his council in the last parliament, for their great
labour and diligence. For, as it appears to the said Commons, my lord
the Prince, and the other lords, have well and loyally done their duty
according to their promise in that
parliament.<a id="notetag282" name="notetag282"></a><a href="#note282">[282]</a>
And upon that, my
lord the Prince, kneeling, with the other lords, declared by the mouth
of my lord the Prince how they had taken pains and diligence and
labours, according to their promise, and the charge given them in
parliament, to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291">(p. 291)</a></span>
their skill and knowledge. This the King
remembered well, and thanked them most graciously. And he said
besides, that 'he was well assured, if they had possessed larger means
than they had, in the manner it had been spoken by the mouth of my
lord the Prince at the time the King charged them to be of his council
in the said parliament, they would have done their duty to effect more
good than was done, in divers parts, for the defence, honour, good,
and profit of him and his kingdom.' And our lord the King also said,
that he felt very contented with their good and loyal diligence,
counsel, and duty, for the time they had been of his council." This
took place about a month after the Parliament had first met, and
within less than three weeks of its termination. On the very last day
of this same parliament, "the Speaker recommending the persons of the
Queen, of the Prince, and of other the King's sons, prayeth the
advancement of their estates. For which the King giveth hearty
thanks." The question unavoidably forces itself upon the mind of every
one.&mdash;Could such a transaction as that, by which the fair fame of the
Prince is attempted to be destroyed for ever, have taken place in this
parliament? It may be deemed superfluous to add, that, though the
records of this parliament are very full and minute, not the most
distant allusion occurs to any such conduct of the Prince.</p>

<p>But whilst, as we have seen, there had arisen much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292">(p. 292)</a></span>
discontent among the people with regard to the royal expenditure and
the government of the King's household, the King in his turn had
entertained feelings of dissatisfaction towards his parliament; in
consequence, no doubt, of the plain and unreserved manner in which
they had given utterance to their sentiments. When two parties are
thus on the eve of a rupture, there never are wanting spirits of a
temper (from the mere love of evil, or in the hope of benefiting
themselves,) to foment the rising discord, and fan the smoking fuel
into a flame. Such was the case in this instance, and such (as we
shall soon see) was the case also in a course of proceedings far more
closely united with the immediate subject of these Memoirs. On the
same day, the last of the parliament, the Lords and Commons,
addressing the King by petition, express their grief at the
circulation of a report that he was offended on account of some
matters done in this and the last parliament; and they pray him "to
declare that he considers each and every of those in the estates of
parliament to be loyal and faithful subjects," which petition the King
of his especial grace in full parliament granted. This submission on
the part of the parliament, and its gracious acceptance by the King,
seem to have allayed, at least for a time, all hostile feeling between
them.</p>

<p>The prayer of the parliament to the King, that he would express his
own and the nation's thanks to the Prince and the other members of his
council, has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name="page293">(p. 293)</a></span>
been thought to imply some suspicion on their
part that the royal favour was withdrawn from the Prince, that the
King was jealous of his influence, and was therefore backward in
publicly acknowledging his obligations to his son. Be this as it may,
two points seem to press themselves on our notice here:&mdash;first, that
up to the May of the following year, 1412, no appearance is
discoverable of any coolness or alienation of regard and confidence
between the Prince and the King;&mdash;the second point is, that it is
scarcely possible to read the disjointed records of the intervening
months between the spring of that year and the next winter, without a
strong suspicion suggesting itself, that the cordial harmony with
which the royal father and his son had lived was unhappily interrupted
for a time, and that misunderstandings and jealousies had been
fostered to separate them. The subject is one of lively interest, and,
though involved in much mystery, must not be disposed of without
investigation; and, whilst we claim at the hands of others to "set
down nought in malice," we must "nothing extenuate," nor allow any
apprehension of consequences to suppress or soften the very truth. The
Author feels himself bound to state not only the mere details of facts
from which inferences might be drawn, but to offer unreservedly his
own opinion, formed upon a patient research, and an honest weighing of
whatever evidence he may have found. The results of his inquiries,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294">(p. 294)</a></span>
after looking at the point in all the bearings in which his
own reflections or the suggestions of others have placed it, is this:</p>

<p>Henry of Monmouth was assigned on the 12th of May 1407, with the
consent of the council, to remain about the person of the King, that
he might devote himself more constantly to the public service;
probably the declining health of the King even then made such a
measure desirable. From the hour when the Prince became president of
the council, his influence through every rank of society naturally
grew very rapidly, and extended to every branch of the executive
government. Petitions were presented to him by name, not only by
inferior applicants, but even by his brothers. Letters of
recommendation were addressed to him by foreigners; and, in more than
one instance, his interest was sought even by the Pope himself. When
the King was personally present in the council, the record states,
that the business was conducted "in the presence of the King, and of
his son the Prince." The father retained the name, the son exercised
the powers of sovereign. Such pre-eminence, as long as human nature
remains the same, will give offence to some, and will engender
envyings and jealousies and oppositions: nor was the Prince suffered
long to enjoy his high station unmolested. Who were the persons more
especially engaged in the unkind office of severing the father from
his son, is matter of conjecture; so is also the immediate cause and
occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295">(p. 295)</a></span>
of their disunion. One of the oldest
chroniclers<a id="notetag283" name="notetag283"></a><a href="#note283">[283]</a>
would induce us to believe that a temporary
estrangement was effected in consequence of some malicious detractors
having misrepresented the Prince's conduct with reference to the Dukes
of Burgundy and Orleans. Some may suspect that the appointment of his
brother Thomas to take the command of the troops in the expedition to
Guienne, when their father's increasing malady prevented him from
putting into execution his design of conducting that campaign in
person, might have given umbrage to the Prince, and led to an open
rupture. And undoubtedly it would have been only natural, had the
Prince felt that, in return for all his labours and his devoted
exertions in the field and at the council-board, the honourable post
of commanding the armament to Guienne should have been assigned to him
as the representative of his diseased
parent.<a id="notetag284" name="notetag284"></a><a href="#note284">[284]</a>
But, perhaps, this
was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296">(p. 296)</a></span>
not in his thoughts at all. Certainly no trace in our
histories or public documents is discoverable of any coolness or
distance<a id="notetag285" name="notetag285"></a><a href="#note285">[285]</a>
prevailing afterwards between himself and his brother
Thomas, as though he regarded him as a rival and supplanter. Hardyng
(the two editions of whose poem, brought out at distant times, and
under different auspices, in many cases give a very different
colouring to the same transaction,) represents the time of the
Prince's dismissal from the council, and the temporary quarrel between
him and his father, to have followed soon after the return of the
English soldiers sent to aid the Duke of Burgundy. His second edition,
however, paints in more unfavourable colours the opposition of the
Prince to his father, and sinks that voluntary return to filial
obedience and regard which his first edition had described in
expressions implying praise. In the Lansdowne manuscript, or first
edition, an original marginal note directs the reader to observe "How
the King and the Prince fell at great discord, and soon accorded."</p>

<p class="poem">
 <span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297">(p. 297)</a></span>
"Then came they home with great thanks and reward,<br>
 So, of the Duke of Burgoyne without fail.<br>
 Soon after then (befel it afterward)<br>
 The Prince was then discharged of counsaile.<br>
 His brother Thomas then, for the King's availe,<br>
 Was in his stead then set by ordinance,<br>
 For which the <i>Prince</i> and <i>he</i> fell at distance.<br>
 With whom the King took part, in great sickness,<br>
 Again[st] the Prince with all his excellence.<br>
 But with a rety of lords and soberness<br>
 The Prince came into his magnificence<br>
 Obey, and hole with all benevolence<br>
 Unto the King, and fully were accord<br>
 Of all matters of which they were discord."</p>


<p>In his later publication, the same writer gives a very different
colouring to the whole proceeding on the part of the Prince; robbing
him of his hearty good-will towards reconciliation, and representing
his return to a right understanding with his father as the result
rather of defeat and compulsion; but this was at a time when the star
of the house of Lancaster had set, and when the house of York was in
the ascendant.</p>

<p class="poem">
"The King discharged the Prince from his counsail,<br>
 And set my lord Sir Thomas in his stead<br>
 Chief of council, for the King's more avail.<br>
 For which the Prince, of wrath and wilful head,<br>
 Again[st] him made debate and froward head;<br>
 With whom the King took part, and held the field<br>
 To time the Prince unto the King him yield."</p>


<p>Either of these representations of Hardyng will fully account for
Shakspeare's</p>

<p class="poem">
"Thy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298">(p. 298)</a></span>
place in council thou hast rudely lost,<br>
 Which by thy younger brother is
supplied:"<a id="notetag286" name="notetag286"></a><a href="#note286">[286]</a>
</p>

<p>though the poet, by fixing the interview between Henry and his father
before the battle of Shrewsbury, has made the expulsion of the Prince
from the council precede his original admission into it by four years,
and his withdrawal from it by at least eight or nine years. It must
here be remarked, that no historical document records the presence of
Thomas Duke of Clarence as a member of the council-board: though, at
the same time, the records in which we might have expected to find his
presence registered, by observing a similar silence with regard to the
Prince, seem to leave little doubt that Henry had ceased to attend the
board a year before his father's death. Some strong though obscure
passages, moreover, in the Chronicles of the time, would go far to
suggest the probability of a demonstration of his power and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299">(p. 299)</a></span>
influence through the country having actually taken place on the part
of the Prince. Thus the Chronicle of London records, that "on the last
day of June the Prince came to London with much people and gentles,
and remained in the Bishop of Durham's house till July 11th. And the
King, who was then at St. John's house, removed to the Bishop of
London's palace, and thence to his house at
Rotherhithe."<a id="notetag287" name="notetag287"></a><a href="#note287">[287]</a>
But the
Chronicle suggests no reason for these movements and ambiguous
proceedings. Thus, too, on the 23rd of September, the mere fact is
stated that "Prince Henry came to the council with a huge people,"
supplying no clue as to the meaning and intention of the concourse. It
cannot, moreover, escape observation, that, though the King held a
council at Rotherhithe on the 8th and on the 10th of July, the Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300">(p. 300)</a></span>
was not present: on the 9th, also, when his brother Thomas
was created Duke of Clarence and Earl of Albemarle, though the Bishop
of Durham, at whose house the Prince was staying, witnessed the
creation, the Prince was not himself one of the witnesses. This
circumstance, indeed may be so interpreted as to remove all idea of
open hostility prevailing at that time between the King and the
Prince. The prelate, it may fairly be supposed, would scarcely have
been a welcome attendant at Rotherhithe, if he were showing all kind
and free hospitality to a rebellious son, who was acting at that very
time in menacing defiance of his father, and evincing by the
demonstration of his numerous and powerful friends the fixed purpose
of avenging himself for whatever insults he might believe himself to
have received from the court party.</p>

<p>Equally in the dark do our records leave us as to the persons who were
the fomentors of this breach between father and son. The oldest
historians intimate that there were mischief-makers, whose malicious
designs were for a time successful. Subsequent events (referred to
hereafter in these volumes) compel us to entertain a strong suspicion
that the Queen (Johanna) was at the head of a party resolved, if
possible, to check the growing and absorbing interest of her
son-in-law in the national council, to diminish his power, and tarnish
his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301">(p. 301)</a></span>
honour.<a id="notetag288" name="notetag288"></a><a href="#note288">[288]</a>
Be this as it may, there are, to be placed
in the opposite scale, facts at which we have already slightly
glanced, seeming to imply that things were going on smoothly between
Henry and his father, even through that brief interval of time about
which alone any doubts can be reasonably entertained. A Minute of the
Council, apparently between the July and September of this year
(1412), records that "it is the King's pleasure for my lord the
Prince<a id="notetag289" name="notetag289"></a><a href="#note289">[289]</a>
to have payment on an assignment for the wages of his men
still in his pay in Wales:" and on the 21st of October, in a council
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302">(p. 302)</a></span>
at Merton, "the King wills that the treasurer of Calais shall
not interfere with any receipt or payments henceforward till otherwise
advised; and that the treasurer of England shall receive all the
monies arising from the third part of the subsidy on wools, to be paid
by him from time to time at his discretion to the treasurer of Calais,
with such intent that my lord the Prince, Captain of the town of
Calais, might the more readily receive payment of what is in arrear to
him and his soldiers living with him, according to the agreement; and
also for the increase of his soldiers by the ordinance of the King
beyond the number comprised in that agreement."</p>

<p>On the whole of this extraordinary and mysterious passage of Henry of
Monmouth's life, the Author must confess that it will be no surprise
to him to find (with a mass of other matter more voluminous and
important than we may now anticipate) new evidence affecting Henry's
character, probably to his utter exculpation, possibly to his
disadvantage, yet forthcoming from the countless treasures of
unpublished records. Meanwhile, he can now, after a patient
examination of all the books and manuscripts, original documents and
subsequent histories, with which it has been his lot to meet, only
return a verdict upon the evidence before him. And the inferences in
which alone he has been able satisfactorily to acquiesce, are
these:&mdash;First, that, after the Prince had for some time been most
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303">(p. 303)</a></span>
active and indefatigable President of the Council; he ceased to
retain that office in consequence of a misunderstanding between
himself and his father, fostered by some persons whose interest or
malicious pleasure instigated them to so unworthy an expedient:
Secondly, that after a demonstration of his strength in the affections
and devotedness of the people, for the purpose (not of acting with
violence or intimidation towards the
King,<a id="notetag290" name="notetag290"></a><a href="#note290">[290]</a>
but) of convincing his
enemies that the machinations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304">(p. 304)</a></span>
of jealousy and detraction
would have no power permanently to blast his reputation, and crush his
influence, the alienation was soon happily terminated by the frank and
filial conduct of the Prince, who as anxiously sought a full
reconciliation as his father willingly conceded it: Thirdly, that,
through the last months of his life, the King was free from all
uneasiness and disquietude on that ground; and that the illness which
terminated his earthly career, instead of being aggravated by the
Prince's undutiful demeanour, was lightened by his affectionate
attendance; and the dying monarch was comforted by the tender offices
of his son.</p>

<p>On the whole (allowing for inaccuracies as well of addition as of
omission, which, though incapable of any specific correction, must
perhaps exist in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305">(p. 305)</a></span>
so detailed a narrative,) we shall not be
far from the truth if we accept in its general outline the relation of
this event as we find it in Stowe.</p>

<p>"Henry, the Prince, offended with certain of his father's family, who
were said to sow discord between the father and the son, wrote unto
all the parts of the realm, endeavouring himself to refute all the
practices and imaginations of such detractors and slanderous people;
and, to make the matter more manifest to the world, he came to the
King, his father, about the Feast of Peter and Paul, with such a
number of his friends and wellwishers, as a greater had not been seen
in those days. He was straightway admitted to his father's presence,
of whom this one thing he besought of him, that if such as had accused
him might be convicted of unjust accusation, they might be punished,
not according to their deserts, but yet, after their lies were proved,
they might somewhat taste of that which they had meant, although not
to the uttermost. The which request the King seemed to grant; but he
told him that he must tarry a parliament, that such might be tried and
punished by judgment of their
peers."<a id="notetag291" name="notetag291"></a><a href="#note291">[291]</a>
Stowe refers to the work
ascribed to Otterbourne, the sentiments of which he faithfully
represents, and then proceeds with the further narrative. "The King
had entertained suspicions in consequence of the Prince's excesses,
and the great
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306">(p. 306)</a></span>
recourse of people unto him, of which his
court was at all times more abundant than his father's, that he would
presume to usurp the crown; so that, in consequence of this suspicious
jealousy, he withdrew in part his affection and singular love from the
Prince.<a id="notetag292" name="notetag292"></a><a href="#note292">[292]</a>
He was accompanied by a large body of lords and
gentlemen; but those he would not suffer to advance beyond the fire in
the hall, in order to remove all suspicion from his father of any
intention to overawe or intimidate him. As soon as the Prince had
declared to his father that his life was not so desirable to him that
he would wish to live one day to his father's displeasure, and that he
coveted not so much his own life as his father's pleasure and welfare,
the King embraced the Prince, and with tears addressed him: 'My right
dear and heartily beloved son, it is of truth that I had you partly
suspect, and, as I now perceive, undeserved on your part. I will have
you no longer in distrust for any reports that shall be made unto me.
And thereof I assure you upon my honour.' Thus, by his great wisdom,
was the wrongful imagination of his father's hate utterly avoided, and
himself restored to the King's former grace and favour."</p>

<p>Stowe
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name="page307">(p. 307)</a></span>
then reports that after Christmas the King called a
parliament (on the morrow of the Purification, February 3,) to the end
of which he did not survive. During his illness, which became much
worse from about Christmas, he gave most excellent advice to Henry;
the particulars of which, as recorded by Stowe, are probably more the
fruits of the writer's imagination than the faithful transcript of any
recorded sentiments. Still the possibility of their having existed in
documents since lost, may perhaps be deemed a sufficient reason for
assigning to them a place in this work.</p>

<p>"'My dear and well-beloved son, I beseech thee, and upon my blessing
charge thee, that, like as thou hast said, so thou minister justice
equally, and in no wise suffer them that be oppressed long to call
upon thee for justice; but redress oppressions, and indifferently and
without delay: for no persuasion of flatterers, nor of them that be
partial, or such as have their hands replenished with gifts, defer not
justice till to-morrow if that thou mayest do justice this day, lest
peradventure God do justice on thee in the mean time, and take from
thee thine authority. Remember that the wealth of thy body and thy
soul and of thy realm resteth in the execution of justice: and do not
thy justice so that thou be called a tyrant; but use thyself in the
middle way between justice and mercy in those things that belong to
thee. And between parties do justice truly, to the consolation of thy
poor subjects
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308">(p. 308)</a></span>
that suffer injuries, and to the punishment of
them that be extortioners and doers of oppression, that others thereby
may take example; and in thus doing thou shalt obtain the favour of
God, and the love and fear of thy subjects; and therefore also thou
shalt have thy realm more in tranquillity and rest, which shall be
occasion of great prosperity within thy realm, which Englishmen
naturally do desire; for, so long as they have wealth and riches, so
long shalt thou have obeisance; and, when they be poor, then they be
always ready at every motion to make insurrections, and it causeth
them to rebel against their sovereign lord; for the nature of them is
such rather to fear losing of their goods and worldly substance, than
the jeopardy of their lives. And if thou thus keep them in subjection,
mixed with love and fear, thou shalt have the most peaceable and
fertile country, and the most loving, faithful, and manly people of
the world; which shall be cause of no small fear to thine adversaries.
My son, when it shall please God to call me to the way decreed for
every worldly creature, to thee, as my son and heir, I must leave my
crown and my realm; which I advise thee not to take vainly, and as a
man elate in pride, and rejoiced in worldly honour; but think that
thou art more oppressed with charge to purvey for every person within
the realm, than exalted by vain honour of the world. Thou shalt be
exalted unto the crown for the wealth and conservation of the realm,
and not for thy singular commodity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309">(p. 309)</a></span>
and avail. My son, thou
shalt be a minister unto thy realm, to keep it in tranquillity and to
defend it. Like as the heart in the midst of the body is principal and
chief thing, and serveth to covet and desire that thing that is most
necessary to every of thy members; so, my son, thou shalt be amongst
thy people as chief and principal of them, to minister, imagine, and
acquire those things that may be most beneficial unto them. And then
thy people shall be obedient unto thee, to aid and succour thee, and
in all things to accomplish thy commandments, like as thy ministers
labour every one in his office to acquire and get that thing that thy
heart desireth: and as thy heart is of no force, and impotent, without
the aid of thy members, so without thy people thy reign is nothing. My
son, thou shalt fear and dread God above all things; and thou shalt
love, honour, and worship him with all thy heart: thou shalt attribute
and ascribe to him all things wherein thou seest thyself to be well
fortunate, be it victory of thine enemies, love of thy friends,
obedience of thy subjects, strength and activeness of body, honour,
riches, or fruitful generations, or any other thing, whatever it be,
that chanceth to thy pleasure. Thou shalt not imagine that any such
thing should fortune to thee by thine act, nor by thy desert; but thou
shalt think that all cometh only of the goodness of the Lord. Thus
shalt thou with all thine heart praise, honour, and thank God for all
his benefits
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310">(p. 310)</a></span>
that he giveth unto thee. And in thyself eschew
all vainglory and elation of heart, following the wholesome counsel of
the Psalmist, which saith, 'Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us! but unto
thy name give the praise!' These, and many other admonitions and
doctrines, this victorious King gave unto this noble Prince his son,
who with effect followed the same after the death of his father,
whereby he obtained grace of our Lord to attain to great victories,
and many glorious and incredible conquests, through the help and
succour of our Lord, whereof he was never destitute."</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>For the exquisitely beautiful picture of Shakspeare, called by some
'The Chamber Scene,' by others 'The Crown Scene,' the materials
probably were gathered from Monstrelet, whose narrative is the only
evidence we now have of the incident. That narrative, indeed, is not
contradicted by any other account; still its authenticity is very
questionable. It is, perhaps, impossible not to entertain a suspicion
that a French writer would, without much enquiry, admit an anecdote by
which Henry IV. is made to disclaim all title to the English throne,
and, by immediate consequence, all title to the English possessions in
the fair realm of France. It is also improbable either that Henry IV.
would have uttered this sentiment in the presence of a witness, or
that his son would have made it known to others. Monstrelet's
anecdote, nevertheless, being the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311">(p. 311)</a></span>
source of so inimitable a
scene as Shakspeare has drawn from it, deserves a place here: "The
King's attendant, not perceiving him to breathe, concluded he was
dead, and covered his face with a cloth. The crown was then upon a
cushion near the bed. The Prince, believing his father to be dead,
took away the crown. Shortly after, the King uttered a groan, and
revived; and, missing his crown, sent for his son, and asked why he
had removed it. The Prince mentioned his supposition that his father
had died. The King gave a deep sigh, and said, 'My fair son, what
right have you to it? you knew I had none.'&mdash;'My lord,' replied Henry,
'as you have held it by right of your sword, it is my intent to hold
and defend it the same during my life.' The King answered, 'Well, all
as you see best; I leave all things to God, and pray that he will have
mercy on me.' Shortly after, without uttering another word, he
expired."<a id="notetag293" name="notetag293"></a><a href="#note293">[293]</a></p>

<p>Henry IV. expired on Monday, March 20, 1413; and his remains were
taken to Canterbury, and there interred near the grave of his first
wife. Clement
Maidstone<a id="notetag294" name="notetag294"></a><a href="#note294">[294]</a> testifies to his having heard a man swear
to his father, that he threw the body into the Thames between Barking
and Gravesend; but, on a late investigation, under the superintendence
of members of the cathedral, the body was found still to be in the
coffin, proving the falsehood of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312">(p. 312)</a></span>
this foolish
story.<a id="notetag295" name="notetag295"></a><a href="#note295">[295]</a>
The funeral was celebrated with great solemnity; and Henry V. attended
in person to assist in paying this last homage of respect to the
earthly remains of his sovereign and father.</p>

<p>The hour of his father's death having been fixed upon as the date of
Henry's reputed conversion from a career of thoughtless dissipation
and reckless profligacy to a life of religion and virtue, this may
appear to be the most suitable place for a calm review of his previous
character and conduct.</p>

<p>In the very threshold of our inquiry, perhaps the most remarkable
circumstance to be observed is this, that whilst the charges now so
unsparingly and unfeelingly brought against his character, rest solely
on the vague, general, and indefinite assertions of writers, (many of
whom appear to aim at exalting his repentance into somewhat
approaching a miraculous conversion,) no one single act of
violence,<a id="notetag296" name="notetag296"></a><a href="#note296">[296]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314">(p. 314)</a></span>
intemperance, injustice, immorality, or even
levity of any kind, religious or moral, is placed upon record. Either
sweeping and railing accusations are alleged, unsubstantiated by proof
or argument; or else his subsequent repentance is cited to bear
testimony to his former misdoings. Thus one writer
asserts;<a id="notetag297" name="notetag297"></a><a href="#note297">[297]</a>
"This
monarch, in the former part of his life, was remarkable for
dissipation and extravagance of conduct; in the latter, he became the
slave of the popedom. Voluptuousness, ambition, superstition, each in
their turn had the ascendant in this extraordinary character." Thus
does another sum up the whole question in one short
note:<a id="notetag298" name="notetag298"></a><a href="#note298">[298]</a>
"The
assertions of his reformation are so express, that the fact cannot be
justly questioned without doubting all history; and, if there were
reformation, there must have been previous
errors."<a id="notetag299" name="notetag299"></a><a href="#note299">[299]</a></p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315">(p. 315)</a></span>
expressions of Walsingham, (being the same in his
History, and in the work called "Ypodigma Neustriæ," or "A Sketch of
Normandy," which he dedicated to Henry V. himself,) are considered by
some persons to have laid an insurmountable barrier in the way of
those who would remove from Henry's "brow," as Prince, "the stain" of
"wildness, riot, and dishonour." And, doubtless, no one who would
discharge the office of an upright judge or an honest witness, would
either suppress or gloss over the passage which is supposed to present
these formidable difficulties, or withdraw from the balance a particle
of the full weight which might appear after examination to belong to
that passage as its own. In our inquiry, however, we must be upon our
guard against the fallacy in which too many writers, when handling
this question, have indulged by arguing in a circle. We must not first
say, Walsingham bears testimony to Henry's early depravity, therefore
we must believe him to have been guilty; and then conclude, because
tradition fixes delinquency on Henry's early days, therefore
Walsingham's passage can admit only of that interpretation which fixes
the guilt upon him. Let Walsingham's text be fairly sifted upon its
own merits; and then, whatever shall appear to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316">(p. 316)</a></span>
his
meaning of an adverse nature, let that be added to the evidence
against Henry; and let the whole be put into the scale, and weighed
against whatever may be alleged in refutation of the charges with
which his memory has been assailed. It would be the result then of a
morbid deference to the opinions of others, rather than the judgment
of his own reasoning, were the Author to withhold his persuasion that
more importance has been assigned to Walsingham's words than a full
and unbiassed scrutiny into their real bearing would sanction. To the
judgment of each individually must this branch of evidence, no less
than the entire question of Henry's moral character, be left. A
transcript of Walsingham's words, as they appear in the printed
editions of his History and in the "Ypodigma
Neustriæ,"<a id="notetag300" name="notetag300"></a><a href="#note300">[300]</a>
will be
found at the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317">(p. 317)</a></span>
foot of the
page.<a id="notetag301" name="notetag301"></a><a href="#note301">[301]</a>
The following is
probably as close a rendering of the original, as the strangely
metaphorical, and in some cases the obscure expressions of Walsingham
will bear. "On which day [of Henry's coronation] there was a very
severe storm of snow, all persons marvelling at the roughness of the
weather. Some considered the disturbance of the atmosphere as
portending the new King's destiny to be cold in action, severe in
discipline and in the exercise of the royal functions; others, forming
a milder estimate of the person of the King, interpreted this
inclemency of the sky as the best omen, namely, that the King himself
would cause the colds and snows of vices to fall in his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318">(p. 318)</a></span>
reign, and the mild fruits of virtues to spring up; so that, with
practical truth, it might be said by his subjects, 'The winter is
past, the rain is over and gone.' For verily, as soon as he was
initiated with the chaplet of royalty, he suddenly was changed into
another man, studying rectitude, modesty, and gravity, [or propriety,
moderation, and steadiness,] desiring to exercise every class of
virtue without omitting any; whose manners and conduct were an example
to persons of every condition in life, as well of the clergy as of the
laity."</p>

<p>Unquestionably, from these expressions an inference may be drawn
fairly, and without harshness or exaggeration, that the "changed man"
had been in times past negligent of some important branches of moral
duty; vehement, hasty, and impetuous in his general proceedings; and
not considering in his pursuits their fitness for his station and
place; in a word, guilty of moral delinquencies immediately opposed to
the virtues enumerated. On the other hand, by specifying those three
moral qualities, (in which this passage is interpreted to imply that
Henry's life had undergone a sudden and total change,&mdash;rectitude,
modesty, and steadiness,) Walsingham appears to have selected exactly
those identical points, for Henry's full possession of which the
parliament of England had felicitated his father; and which, either
separately, or in combination with other excellencies, continued to be
ascribed to him at various times, as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page319" name="page319">(p. 319)</a></span>
occasion offered, even
to a period within a few months of his accession to the throne. Never
did a young man receive from his contemporaries more unequivocal
testimony to the practical exercise in his person of propriety,
modesty, and perseverance, than Henry of Monmouth received before he
became King.</p>

<p>It may be said, and with perfect fairness, that the testimony of
parliament to his virtues so early as the year 1406 leaves a most
important chasm in a young man's life, during which he might have
fallen from his integrity, and have rapidly formed habits of the
opposite vices. But through that period no expressions occur in
history which even by implication involve any degeneracy, any change
from good to bad. On the contrary, to his zeal and steadiness, and
perseverance and integrity, such incidental testimony is borne from
time to time as would of itself leave a very different impression on
the mind from that which Walsingham's words in their usual acceptation
would convey; whilst no allusion whatever is discernible to any habits
or practices contrary to the principles of religious and moral
self-government. Indeed, it has been, not without reason, doubted
whether, in the absence of more positive testimony, such sudden
changes, first from good to bad, and then from bad to good, be not in
themselves improbable.</p>

<p>On the whole, whilst each must be freely left to pronounce his own
verdict, it is here humbly but sincerely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320">(p. 320)</a></span>
suggested that
Walsingham's words fairly admit of an interpretation more in
accordance with the view of Henry's moral worth generally adopted in
these Memoirs; namely, that his character rose suddenly with the
occasion; that new energies were called into action by his new duties;
that his moral and intellectual powers kept on a level with his
elevation to so high a dignity, and with such an increase of power and
influence; and that he continued to excite the admiration of the world
by improving rapidly in every excellence, as his awful sense of the
momentous responsibility he then for the first time felt imposed upon
him grew in strength and intenseness. He became "another, a new man,"
by giving himself up with all his soul to his new duties as sovereign;
and by cultivating with practical devotedness those virtues which
might render him (and which, as Walsingham says, did actually render
him) a bright and shining example to every class of his
subjects.<a id="notetag302" name="notetag302"></a><a href="#note302">[302]</a></p>

<p>Undoubtedly most of the subsequent chroniclers not only speak of his
reformation, but broadly state that he had given himself very great
licence in self-gratification, and therefore needed to be reformed.
Before Shakspeare's day, the reports adopted by our historiographers
had fully justified him in his representation of Henry's early
courses; and, since his time, few writers have considered it their
duty to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name="page321">(p. 321)</a></span>
verify the exquisite traits of his pencil, or
examine the evidence on which he rested.</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="poem1">"His addiction was to courses vain;</span><br>
His companies unlettered, rude, and shallow;<br>
His hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports;<br>
And never noted in him any study,<br>
Any retirement, any sequestration<br>
From open haunts and popularity."</p>


<p>Let the investigator who is resolved not to yield an implicit and
blind assent to vague assertion, however positive, and how often
soever repeated, well and truly try for himself the issue by evidence,
and trace Henry from his boyhood; let him search with unsparing
diligence and jealous scrutiny through every authentic document
relating to him; let his steps be followed into the marches, the
towns, the valleys, and the mountains of Wales; let him be watched
narrowly month after month during his residence in London, or wherever
he happened to be staying with the court, or in Calais during his
captaincy there; and not a single hint occurs of any one
irregularity.<a id="notetag303" name="notetag303"></a><a href="#note303">[303]</a>
The research will bring to light no single
expression savouring of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322">(p. 322)</a></span>
impiety, dissoluteness, carelessness,
or even levity.</p>

<p>Testimony, on the other hand, ample and repeated, as we have already
seen in these pages, is borne to his valour, and unremitting exertions
and industry; to his firmness of purpose, his integrity his filial
duty and affection; his high-mindedness (in the best sense of the
word), his generous spirit, his humanity, his habits of mind, so
unsuspecting as to expose him often to the over-reaching designs of
the crafty and the unprincipled, his pious trust in Providence, and
habitual piety and devotion. To these, and other excellences in his
moral compound, his
father,<a id="notetag304" name="notetag304"></a><a href="#note304">[304]</a>
and his father's antagonist,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323">(p. 323)</a></span>
Hotspur, the assembled parliament of England, the common people
of Wales, the gentlemen of distant counties, contemporary chroniclers,
(combined with the public records of the kingdom and the internal
evidence of his own letters,) bear direct and unstinted witness. From
the first despatch of Hotspur to the last vote of thanks in
parliament, there is a chain of testimonies (detailed in their
chronological order in previous chapters of this work) very seldom
equalled in the case of so young a man, and, through so long a period,
perhaps never surpassed. And yet, though he was through the whole of
that time the constant object of observation, and the subject of men's
thoughts and words, no complaint of any neglect of duty arrests our
notice, nor is there even an insinuation thrown out of any excess,
indiscretion, or extravagance whatever. Not a word from the tongue of
friend or foe, of accuser or apologist, would induce us to suspect
that anything wrong was stifled or kept back. There are complaints of
the extravagant expenditure of his father, and recommendations of
retrenchment and economy in the King's household; but never on any
occasion, (even when the Prince is most urgent and importunate for
supplies of money, offering the most favourable and inviting
opportunity for remonstrance or remark), is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page324" name="page324">(p. 324)</a></span>
there the
slightest innuendo either from the King, the Lords of the council, or
the Commons in parliament, that he expended the least sum
unnecessarily.<a id="notetag305" name="notetag305"></a><a href="#note305">[305]</a>
No improper channel of expense, public or private,
domestic or personal, is glanced at; nothing is objected to in his
establishment; no item is recommended to be abolished or curtailed; no
change of conduct is hinted at as desirable. And yet subsequent
writers speak with one accord of his reformation; "and reformation
implies previous errors." After examining whatever documents
concerning him the most diligent research could discover, the Author
is compelled to report as his unbiassed and deliberate judgment, that
the character with which Henry of Monmouth's name has been stamped for
profligacy and dissipation, is founded, not on the evidence of facts,
but on the vagueness of tradition. Still such is the tradition, and it
must stand for its due value. And if we allow tradition to tell us of
his faults, we must in common fairness receive from the same tradition
the fullness of his reformation; if we give credence to one who
reports both his guilt and his penitence, we must record both
accounts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325">(p. 325)</a></span>
or neither. Before, however, we repeat what
tradition has delivered down as to Henry's conduct and behaviour
immediately upon his father's death, it may be well for us to review
some of those testimonies to his character, his principles, and his
conduct, which incidentally (but not on that account less acceptably
or less satisfactorily) offer themselves to our notice, scattered up
and down through the pages of former days.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Were we to draw an inference from the summary way in which many modern
authors have cut short the question with regard to Henry of Monmouth's
character as Prince of Wales, we should conclude that all the evidence
was on one side; that, whilst "it is unfair to distinguished merit to
dwell on the blemishes which it has regretted and reformed," still no
doubt can be entertained of his having, "from a too early initiation
into military life, stooped to practise irregularities between the
ages of sixteen and
twenty-five."<a id="notetag306" name="notetag306"></a><a href="#note306">[306]</a>
Whereas the fact is, that no
allusion to such irregularities is made where we might have expected
to find it; and that, independently of those more formal proofs to the
contrary which are embodied in these pages, and to which we have above
briefly referred, contemporary writers and undisputed documents supply
us with materials for judging of his temper of mind and early
habit,&mdash;the character, in short, with which those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name="page326">(p. 326)</a></span>
who had
the best opportunities of knowing him, were wont to associate his
name.</p>

<p>All accounts agree in reporting him to have been devotedly fond of
music. As the household expenses of his father informed us, he played
upon the harp before he was ten years old; nor does he seem ever to
have lost the habit of deriving gratification from the same art. It
were easy to represent him prostituting this love of minstrelsy in the
haunts of Eastcheap, and enjoying "through the sweetest morsel of the
night" the songs of impurity in reckless Bacchanalian revels,
self-condemned indeed, and therefore to be judged by others leniently:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="poem1">"I feel me much to blame</span><br>
So idly to profane the precious
time:"<a id="notetag307" name="notetag307"></a><a href="#note307">[307]</a>
</p>

<p>but nevertheless guilty of profaning the sacred art of music in the
midst of worthless companions, and in the very sinks of low and
dissolute profligacy. This it were easy to do, and this has been done.
But history lends no countenance to such representations. The
chroniclers, who refer again and again to his fondness for music, tell
us that it showed itself in him under very different associations. "He
delighted (as Stowe records) in songs, metres, and musical
instruments; insomuch that in his chapel, among his private prayers he
used our Lord's prayer, certain psalms of David, with divers hymns and
canticles, all which <i>I</i> have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327">(p. 327)</a></span>
seen translated into English
metre by John Lydgate, Monk of Bury." In this view we are strongly
confirmed by several items of expense specified in the Pell Rolls,
which record sums paid to organists and singers sent over for the use
of Henry's chapel whilst he was in France; but this, being subsequent
to his supposed conversion, cannot be alleged in evidence on the point
at issue.<a id="notetag308" name="notetag308"></a><a href="#note308">[308]</a>
It only shows that his early acquired love of music
never deserted him.</p>

<p>In this place, moreover, we cannot refrain from anticipating, what
might perhaps have been reserved with equal propriety to a subsequent
page, that the same dry details of the Pell
Rolls<a id="notetag309" name="notetag309"></a><a href="#note309">[309]</a>
enable us to
infer with satisfaction that Henry made his love of minstrelsy
contribute to the gratification of himself and the partner of his joys
and cares, supplying an intimation of domestic habits and conjugal
satisfaction, without which a life passed in the splendour of royalty
must be irksome, and blessed with which the cottage of the poor man
possesses the most enviable treasure. Whether in their home at
Windsor, or during their happy progress through England in the halls
of York and Chester, or in the tented ground on the banks of the Seine
before Melun, our imagination has solid foundation to build
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328">(p. 328)</a></span>
upon when we picture to ourselves Henry and his beloved princess
passing innocently and happily, in minstrelsy and song, some of the
hours spared from the appeals of justice, the exigencies of the state,
or the marshalling of the battle-field.</p>

<p>But that Henry had also imbibed a real love of literature, and valued
it highly, we possess evidence which well deserves attention. He was
so much enamoured of the "Tale of Troy divine," that he directed John
Lydgate, Monk of Bury St. Edmund's, to translate two poems, "The Death
of Hector," and "The Fall of Troy," into English verse, that his own
countrymen might not be behind the rest of Europe in their knowledge
of the works of antiquity. The testimony borne by this author to the
character of Henry for perseverance and stedfastness of purpose; for
sound practical wisdom, and, at the same time, for a ready and ardent
desire of the counsel of the wise; for mercy mingled with high and
princely resolve and love of justice; for all those qualities which
can adorn a Christian prince,&mdash;is so full in itself, and so direct,
and (if honest) is so conclusive, that any memoirs of Henry's life and
character would be culpably defective which should exclude it. The
circumstance, also, of that testimony being couched in the vernacular
language of the times, affords another point of interest to the
English antiquary. Sometimes, indeed, we cannot help suspecting that
the poem has undergone some verbal and grammatical alterations in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329">(p. 329)</a></span>
course of the four centuries which have elapsed since it was
penned; but that circumstance does not affect its credibility.</p>

<p>We may be fully aware that the evidence of a poet dedicating a work to
his patron is open to the suspicion of partiality and flattery, and we
may be willing that as much should be deducted on that score from the
weight of the Monk of Bury's testimony as the reader may impartially
pronounce just; still the naked fact remains unimpeached, that the
poet was importuned by Henry, <i>when Prince</i>, to translate two works
for the use of his countrymen. Lydgate, it must not be forgotten,
expressly declares that he undertook the work at the "high command of
Henry Prince of Wales," and that he entered upon it in the autumn of
1412; the exact time when some would have us believe that he was in
the mid-career of his profligacy, and at open variance with his
father. However, let Lydgate's testimony be valued at a fair price; no
one has ever impeached his character for honesty, or accused him of
flattery. Still he may be guilty in both respects. And yet, in a work
published at that very time, we can scarcely believe that any one
would have addressed a wild profligate and noted prodigal in such
verses; and it is very questionable whether, had he done so, any one
who delighted in libertinism and boasted of his follies would have
been gratified by the ascription to himself of a character in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330">(p. 330)</a></span>
 all points so directly the reverse. If his patron were an example
of irregularities and licentiousness, it is beyond the reach of
ill-nature and credulity combined to hold it probable that he would
have extolled him for self-restraint, for steady moral and mental
discipline, for manliness at once and virtue, for delighting in
ancient lore, and promoting its free circulation far and wide with the
sole purpose and intent of sowing virtue and discountenancing vice.
Such an effusion would have savoured rather of irony and bitter
sarcasm, than of a desire to write what would be acceptable to the
individual addressed. Lydgate's is the testimony, we confess, of a
poet and a friend, but it is the testimony of a contemporary; of one
who saw Henry in his daily walks, conversed with him often, had a
personal knowledge of his habits and predilections; at all events, he
was one who, by recording the fact that Henry, when Prince, urged him
to translate for his countrymen two poems which he had himself
delighted to read in the original, records at the same time the fact
that Henry was himself a scholar, and the patron of ingenuous
learning.</p>

<p>The testimony borne to the character of Henry of Monmouth by the poet
Occleve<a id="notetag310" name="notetag310"></a><a href="#note310">[310]</a>
is more indirect than
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page331" name="page331">(p. 331)</a></span>
Lydgate's, but not on
that account less valuable or satisfactory. Occleve represents himself
as walking pensive and sad, in sorrow of heart, pressed down by
poverty, when he is met by a poor old man who accosts him with
kindness. The poet then details their conversation. He communicates to
the aged man, whom he calls father, his worldly wants and anxiety;
who, addressing him by the endearing name of son, endeavours to
suggest to him some means of procuring a remedy for his distress. His
advice is, to write a poem or two with great pains, and present them
to the Prince, with the full assurance that he would graciously accept
them, and relieve his wants. They must be written, he says, with
especial care, because of the Prince's great skill and judgment;
whilst of their welcome the Prince's gentle and benign bearing towards
all worthy suitors gives a most certain pledge. If Occleve deserves
our confidence, Henry, in the estimation of his contemporaries, even
whilst he was yet Prince of Wales, had the character of a gentle and
kind-hearted man; one whose "heart was full applied to grant," and not
to send a petitioner empty away. Instead of his revelling amidst loose
companions at the Boar in East-Cheap, his contemporaries thought they
should best meet his humour, if they supplied him with a "tale fresh
and
gay,"<a id="notetag311" name="notetag311"></a><a href="#note311">[311]</a>
for his study when he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332">(p. 332)</a></span>
was in his own chamber,
and was still. So far from thinking that an author would suit his
taste by furnishing any of those works which minister what is grateful
to a depraved mind, their admonition was, to write nothing which could
sow the seeds of vice. They deemed him, if any one, able to set the
true value on a literary work; and felt that, if they purposed to
present any production of their own for his perusal and gratification,
they must take especial pains to make it really good. They had formed,
moreover, such an opinion of his high excellence, and his abhorrence
of flattery, that they thought a man had better undertake a pilgrimage
to Jerusalem than be guilty of any indiscretion in this particular.
Let any impartial person
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333">(p. 333)</a></span>
meditate on these things; let him
carefully read the extracts from Lydgate and Occleve which will be
found in the Appendix; and remembering on the one hand that they were
poets anxious to obtain the favour of the court, and on the other that
no single act or word of vice, or insolence, or levity, is recorded of
Henry by any one of his contemporaries, let him then, like an honest
days-man, pronounce his verdict.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>The tradition with regard to Henry's conduct immediately upon his
father's dissolution, as we gather it from various writers who lived
near that time, is one as to the full admission of which even an
eulogist of Henry of Monmouth needs not be jealous; much less will the
candid enquirer be apprehensive of its effect upon the character which
he is investigating. The tradition then is, that Prince Henry was
attending the sick-bed of his father, who, rousing from a slumber into
which he had sunk for a while, asked him what the person was doing
whom he observed in the room. "My father," replied Henry, "it is the
priest, who has just now consecrated the body of our Lord; lift up
your heart in all holy devotion to God!" His father then most
affectionately and fervently blessed him, and resigned his soul into
the hands of his Redeemer. No sooner had the King breathed his last,
than Henry, under an awful sense of his own unworthiness, and of the
vanity of all worldly objects
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334">(p. 334)</a></span>
of desire, conscious also of
the necessity of an abundant supply of divine grace to fit him for the
discharge of the high duties of the kindly office, to which the voice
of Providence then called him, retired forthwith into an inner
oratory. There, prostrate in body and soul, and humbled to the dust
before the majesty of his Creator, he made a full confession of his
past life. Whether the words put into his mouth were the fruits of his
biographer's imagination, or were committed to writing by Henry
himself, (a supposition thought by some by no means improbable,) they
are the words of a sincere Christian penitent. Henry, as we have
frequently been reminded in these Memoirs, seems to have made much
progress in the knowledge of sacred things, and to have become
familiarly acquainted with the Holy Scriptures; and his confessional
prayer breathes the aspirations of one who had made the divine word
his study. He earnestly implores "his most loving Father to have mercy
upon him, not suffering the miserable creature of his hand to perish,
but making him as one of his hired servants." After he had thus poured
out his soul to God in his secret chamber, he went under cover of the
night to a minister of eminent piety, who lived near at hand at
Westminster. To this servant of Christ he opened all his mind, and
received by his kind and holy offices, the consolations and counsels,
the strengthenings and refreshings, which true religion alone can
give, and which it never
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335">(p. 335)</a></span>
withholds from any one, prince or
peasant, who seeks them with sincere purpose of heart, and applies for
them in earnest prayer.</p>

<p>Between his accession and his coronation, Henry of Monmouth was much
engaged in exercises of devotion; and various acts of self-humiliation
are recorded of him. Even in the midst of the splendid banquet of his
coronation, (as persons, says Elmham, worthy of credit can testify,)
he neither ate nor drank; his whole mind and soul seemed to be
absorbed by the thought of the solemn and deep responsibility under
which he then lay. For three days he never suffered himself to indulge
in repose on any soft couch; but with fasting, watching, and prayer,
fervently and perseveringly implored the heavenly aid of the King of
kings for the good government of his people. Doubtless, some may see
in every penitential prayer an additional proof of his former
licentiousness and dissipation: others, it is presumed, may not so
interpret these scenes. Perhaps candour and experience may combine in
suggesting to many Christians that the self-abasement of Henry should
be interpreted, not as a criterion of his former delinquencies in
comparison with the principles and conduct of others, but as an index
rather of the standard of religious and moral excellence by which he
tried his own life; that the rule with reference to which a practical
knowledge of his own deficiency filled him with so great compunction
and sorrow of heart, was not the tone
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336">(p. 336)</a></span>
and fashion of the
world, but the pure and holy law of God; and that, consequently, his
degree of contrition does not imply in him any extraordinary sense of
immorality in his past days, but rather the profound reverence which
he had formed of the divine law, and a consciousness of the lamentable
instances in which he had failed to fulfil
it.<a id="notetag312" name="notetag312"></a><a href="#note312">[312]</a>
Be this as it may,
a calm review of all the intimations with regard to his principles,
his conduct, and his feelings, which history and tradition offer,
seems to suggest to our thoughts the expressions of the Psalmist as
words in which Prince Henry might well and sincerely have addressed
the throne of grace. "I have gone astray, like a sheep that is lost.
O! seek thy servant, for I do not forget thy commandments!"</p>

<p>The Author has already intimated in his Preface the reluctance with
which he undertook to examine the descriptions of the Prince of
dramatic poets with a direct reference to the test of historical
truth; and he cannot enter upon that inquiry in this place without
repeating his regret, nor without alleging some of the reasons which
seem to make the investigation an imperative duty in these Memoirs.</p>

<p>In our endeavours to ascertain the real character and conduct of Henry
V, it is not enough that we close the volume of Shakspeare's dramas,
determining to allow it no weight in the scale of evidence. If
nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338">(p. 338)</a></span>
more be done, Shakspeare's representations will have
weight, despite of our resolution. Were Shakspeare any ordinary
writer, or were the parts of his remains which bear on our subject
few, unimportant, and uninteresting, the biographer, without
endangering the truth, might lay him aside with a passing caution
against admitting for evidence the poet's views of facts and
character. But the large majority of readers in England, who know
anything of those times, have formed their estimate of Henry from the
scenic descriptions of Shakspeare, or from modern historians who have
been indebted for their information to no earlier or more authentic
source than his plays. Even writers of a higher character, and to whom
the English student is much indebted, would tempt us to rest satisfied
with the general inferences to be drawn from the scenes of Shakspeare,
though they willingly allow that much of the detail was the fruit only
of his fertile imagination. A modern
author<a id="notetag313" name="notetag313"></a><a href="#note313">[313]</a>
opens his chapter on
the reign of Henry V. with a passage, a counterpart to which we find
expressed, or at least conveyed by implication, in many other writers,
to whose views, however, the searcher after truth and fact cannot
possibly accede. "With the traditionary irregularities of the youth of
Henry V. we are early familiarized by the magical pen of Shakspeare,
never more fascinating than in portraying the associates and frolics
of this illustrious Prince. But
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339">(p. 339)</a></span>
the personifications of the
poet must not be expected to be found in the chroniclers who have
annalised this reign."&mdash;"The general facts of his irregularities, and
their amendment, have never been forgotten; but no historical Hogarth
has painted the individual adventures of the princely rake."</p>

<p>It is not because we would palliate Henry's vices, if such there be on
record, or disguise his follies, or wish his irregularities to be
forgotten in the vivid recollections of his conquests, that we would
try "our immortal bard" by the test of rigid fact. We do so, because
he is the authority on which the estimate of Henry's character, as
generally entertained, is mainly founded. Mr.
Southey,<a id="notetag314" name="notetag314"></a><a href="#note314">[314]</a>
indeed, is
speaking only of his own boyhood when he says, "I had learned all I
knew of English history from Shakspeare." But very many pass through
life without laying aside or correcting those impressions which they
caught at the first opening of their minds; and never have any other
knowledge of the times of which his dramas speak, than what they have
learned from his representations. The great Duke of Marlborough is
known to have confessed that all his acquaintance with English history
was derived from Shakspeare: whilst not unfrequently persons of
literary pursuits, who have studied our histories for themselves, are
to the last under the practical influence of their earliest
associations: unknown
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340">(p. 340)</a></span>
to their own minds the poet is still
their instructor and guide. And this influence Shakspeare exercises
over the historical literature of his country, though he was born more
than one hundred and sixty years after the historical date of that
scene in which he first speaks of the "royal rake's" strayings and
unthriftiness; and though many new sources, not of vague tradition,
but of original and undoubted record, which were closed to him, have
been opened to students of the present day. It has indeed been alleged
that he might have had means of information no longer available by us;
that manuscripts are forgotten, or lost, which bore testimony to
Henry's career of wantonness. But surely such a suggestion only
renders it still more imperative to examine with strict and exact
scrutiny into the poet's descriptions. If these are at all
countenanced by a coincidence with ascertained historical facts, we
must admit them as evidence, secondary indeed, but still the best
within our reach. But if they prove to be wholly untenable when tested
by facts, and irreconcileable with what history places beyond doubt,
we have solid grounds for rejecting them as legitimate testimonies. We
must consider them either as the fascinating but aëry visions of a
poet who lived after the intervention of more than a century and a
half, or as inferences built by him on documents false and misleading.</p>

<p>It may be said that the poet, in his delineation of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341">(p. 341)</a></span>
the
manners of the time, and in his vivid representations of the sallies
and excesses of a prince notorious for his wildness and profligate
habits, must not be shackled by the rigid and cold bands of historical
verity, any more than we would require of him, in his description of a
battle, the accuracy of a general's bulletin. But if a master poet
should so describe the battle as to involve on the part of the
commander the absence of military skill, and of clear conceptions of a
soldier's duty, or ignorance of the enemy's position and strength, and
of his own resources, or a suspicion of faintheartedness and ungallant
bearing, truth would require us to analyse the description, and either
to restore the fair fame of the commander, or to be convinced that he
had justly lost his military character. On this principle we must
refer Shakspeare's representations to a more unbending standard than a
poet's fantasy.</p>

<p>The first occasion on which reference is found to the habits and
character of Henry, occurs in the tragedy of Richard II, act v. scene
3, in which his father is represented as making inquiries, of "Percy
and other lords," in such terms as these:</p>

<p class="poem">
"Can no man tell of my <i>unthrifty</i> son?<br>
'Tis full <span class="smcap">THREE MONTHS</span> since I did see him last:<br>
If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.<br>
I would to Heaven, my lords, he might be found!<br>
Inquire at London 'mongst the taverns there,<br>
For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,<br>
With unrestrained loose companions;<br>
Even
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name="page342">(p. 342)</a></span>
    such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,<br>
And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;<br>
While he, young, wanton, and effeminate boy,<br>
Takes on the point of honour to support<br>
So dissolute a crew."</p>


<p>To this inquiry <span class="smcap">Percy</span> is made to answer,</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="poem1">"My lord! some two days since I saw the Prince,</span><br>
<span class="poem1">And told him of these triumphs held at Oxford."</span><br>
<i>Bolinbroke</i>.&mdash;"And what said the gallant?"<br>
<i>Percy</i>.&mdash;"His answer was&mdash;he would unto the stews,<br>
<span class="poem1">And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,</span><br>
<span class="poem1">And wear it as a favour; and, with that,</span><br>
<span class="poem1">He would unhorse the lustiest challenger."</span><br>
<i>Bolinbroke</i>.&mdash;"As dissolute as desperate: yet, through both,<br>
<span class="poem1">I see some sparkles of a better hope,</span><br>
<span class="poem1">Which elder days may happily bring forth."</span></p>


<p>To understand what degree of reliance should be placed upon this
passage as a channel of biographical information, it is only necessary
to recal to mind two points established beyond doubt from history:
first, that the Prince was then not twelve years and a half old; and
secondly, that the circumstance, previously to which this lamentation
must be fixed, took place <span class="smcap">not three months</span> after the coronation,
subsequently to which the King created this his "unthrifty son," "this
gallant, dissolute as desperate," Prince of
Wales.<a id="notetag315" name="notetag315"></a><a href="#note315">[315]</a>
The scene is
placed by Shakspeare at Windsor;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343">(p. 343)</a></span>
and the conversation
between Henry IV. inquiring about his son, and Percy, so unkindly
fanning his suspicions, is ended abruptly by the breathless haste of
Lord Albemarle, who breaks in upon the court to denounce the
conspiracy against the King's life. This could not have been later
than January 4, 1400; for on that day the conspirators entered
Windsor, after Henry IV, having been apprised of their plot, had left
that place for London. The coronation was celebrated on the 13th of
the preceding October, and the Prince of Wales was born August 9,
1387. The whole year before his father's coronation he was in the
safe-keeping of Richard II, through some months of it in Ireland; and,
on Richard's return to England, he was left a prisoner in Trym Castle.
How many days before the coronation he was brought from Ireland to his
father, does not appear; probably messengers were sent for him
immediately after Richard fell into the hands of Henry IV. The
certainty is, that "<i>full three months</i> could not have passed" since
they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344">(p. 344)</a></span>
last saw each other; the strong probability is, that
both father and son had kept the feast of Christmas together at
Windsor. That a boy of not twelve years and a half old, just returned
from a year's safe-keeping in the hand of his father's enemy and whom
his father, not three months before, had created Prince of Wales with
all the honours and expressions of regard ever shown on similar
occasions, should have been the leader and supporter of a dissolute
crew of unrestrained loose companions, the frequenter of those sinks
of sin and profligacy which then disgraced the metropolis (as they do
now), is an improbability so gross, that nothing but the excellence of
Shakspeare's pen could have rendered an exposure of it
necessary.<a id="notetag316" name="notetag316"></a><a href="#note316">[316]</a></p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345">(p. 345)</a></span>
second introduction of the same subject occurs in the
scene in the court of London, the very day after the news arrived of
Mortimer being taken by Owyn Glyndowr.</p>

<p class="poem">
<i>Westmoreland</i>.&mdash;"But <i>yesternight</i>; when all athwart there came<br>
<span class="poem1">A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;</span><br>
<span class="poem1">Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,</span><br>
<span class="poem1">Leading the Herefordshire men to fight</span><br>
<span class="poem1">Against the irregular and wild Glyndower,</span><br>
<span class="poem1">Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken."</span></p>


<p>The anachronism of Shakspeare, in making the two reports, of
Mortimer's capture and of the battle of Homildon, reach London on the
same day, though there was an interval of more than three months
between them, only tends to show that we must not look to him as a
channel of historical accuracy. How utterly inappropriate is the
desponding lamentation of Henry IV, the bare reference to actual dates
is alone needed to show.</p>

<p class="poem">
<i>Westmoreland</i>.&mdash;"Faith! 'tis a conquest for a prince to boast of."<br>

<span class="poem1">Then I would have his Harry, and he mine!</span><br>
<span class="poem1">But let him from my thoughts."</span></p>


<p>In this glowing page of Shakspeare is preserved one of those
exquisite, fascinating illusions which are scattered up and down
throughout his never-dying remains, and which, arresting us
everywhere, hold the willing imagination spell-bound, till, after
reflection, Truth rises upon the mind, and with one gleam of her soft
but omnipotent light varies the charm, and contrasts the satisfaction
of reality with the pleasures of fiction. The poet's imagery paints to
our mind's eye Harry Hotspur and Harry of Monmouth lying each in his
"cradle-clothes" on some one and the same night, when the powers of
Fairy-land might have exchanged the boys, and called Percy,
Plantagenet. To effect such a change, however, of the first-born sons
of Northumberland and Bolinbroke, an extent of power and skill must
have been in requisition far beyond what their warmest advocates are
wont to assign to those "night-tripping" personages. Hotspur was at
least one-and-twenty years old when Henry of Monmouth "lay in his
cradle-clothes." The pencil also of the painter has lent its aid to
confirm and propagate the same delusion as to the relative ages of
these two warriors. In the representation (for example) of the
Battle-field of Shrewsbury, Hotspur
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347">(p. 347)</a></span>
and Henry, the heroes in
the fore-ground, are models of two gallant youths, equal in age,
struggling for the mastery: and in the chamber-scene, whilst Henry is
represented in all the freshness of a beardless youth, his father
shows the worn-out veteran; his brow and cheeks deeply furrowed, his
whole frame borne down towards the grave by length of days as much as
by infirmities, though when he died his age did not exceed his
forty-seventh year.</p>

<p>The time of Hotspur's birth has generally been considered matter only
for conjecture; but whether we draw our inferences from undisputed
facts, and the clearest deductions of sound argument, or rest only on
the direct evidence now for the first time, it is presumed, brought
forward, we cannot regard Hotspur at the very lowest calculation as a
single year younger than Henry of Monmouth's father, the very
Bolinbroke whom the poet makes to utter such a lamentation and such a
wish. Bolinbroke's birth-day cannot be assigned (as we have seen) to
an earlier date than April 6, 1366; and the Annals of the
Peerage<a id="notetag317" name="notetag317"></a><a href="#note317">[317]</a>
refer Hotspur's birth to May 20,
1364.<a id="notetag318" name="notetag318"></a><a href="#note318">[318]</a>
The Author, however, is
disposed to think that the Annals have antedated his birth by more
than a year at least. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348">(p. 348)</a></span>
Scrope and Grosvenor
controversy,<a id="notetag319" name="notetag319"></a><a href="#note319">[319]</a>
the record of which supplied us with the ages of
Glyndowr and his brother, the commissioners examined both Hotspur and
his father. The father, usually called the "aged Earl," gave his
testimony on the 19th November 1386, as "the Earl of Northumberland,
of the age of forty-five years, having borne arms thirty years."
Hotspur, who was examined on the 30th of the preceding October, that
is, in the year before Henry of Monmouth was born, gave his testimony
as "Sir Henry Percy, of the age of twenty years." Hotspur must,
therefore, have been born between the end of October 1365 and the end
of October 1366. And if the annalists are right in fixing upon the day
of the year on which he was born, his birth-day was in the month next
following the birth-day of Bolinbroke. On the most probable
calculation, he might have been five months older than Bolinbroke; he
could not have been seven months younger. It is a curious and
interesting circumstance, that, instead of specifying the number of
years through which he had borne arms, Hotspur referred the
commissioners to the first occasion of his having seen and shared the
real service of battle:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page349" name="page349">(p. 349)</a></span>
"First armed when the castle of
Berwick was taken by the Scots, and when the rescue was made." The
surprise of Berwick by the Scots took place on the Thursday before St.
Andrew's day in the year 1378, (which fell on November 25,) so that
Hotspur passed his noviciate in the field of battle when he was only
just past his twelfth year, and almost nine years before Henry of
Monmouth was born. In 1388, when Henry was only one year old, Hotspur
was taken prisoner by the Scots. His eldest son, whom Henry with so
much generosity restored to his honours and estates, was born February
3, 1393.<a id="notetag320" name="notetag320"></a><a href="#note320">[320]</a></p>

<p>Though
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350">(p. 350)</a></span>
these facts prove that Shakspeare has spread through
the world a most erroneous opinion of the relative ages and
circumstances of Bolinbroke, Hotspur,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351">(p. 351)</a></span>
and Henry of
Monmouth,&mdash;a circumstance, indeed, in itself of no great
importance,&mdash;the question on which we are engaged will be more
immediately and strongly affected if it can be shown precisely, that
at the very time when (according to the poet's representation) Henry
IV. uttered this lamentation, expressive of deep present sorrow at the
reckless misdoings of his son, and of anticipations of worse, that
very son was doing his duty valiantly and mercifully in Wales.</p>

<p>On the lowest calculation, a full month before Mortimer's capture, the
young royal warrior had scoured the whole country of Glyndwrdy in
person, and had burnt two of Owyn's mansions; whilst the strong
probability is, that he had headed his troops on that expedition more
than a year before.</p>

<p>It is very remarkable (though Shakspeare doubtless never became
acquainted with the circumstance) that the identical Percy whom he
makes Henry IV. desire to have been his son, instead of his own Henry,
bears ample testimony, at least a full year previously, to the valour
and kind-heartedness of him on whose brow the poet makes his father
lament "the stain of riot and dishonour."</p>

<p>Sir Edmund Mortimer was taken by Glyndowr at Melienydd in Radnor, June
12th, 1402; and, as early as the 3rd of May 1401, Percy wrote from
Caernarvon to the council that North Wales was obedient to the law,
except the rebels of Conway and Rees Castles, who were in the
mountains, whom he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352">(p. 352)</a></span>
expresses his expectation that the Prince
of Wales would subdue. "These will be right well chastened," said he,
"if God please, by the force and governance which my lord the Prince
<i>has</i> sent against them, as well of his council as of his retinue." In
the same letter Hotspur informs the King's council that the commons of
the counties of Caernarvon and Merioneth (who had come before him in
the sessions which he was then holding as Chief Justice of North
Wales) had humbly expressed their thanks to the Prince for the great
pains of his kind good-will in endeavouring to obtain their
pardon."<a id="notetag321" name="notetag321"></a><a href="#note321">[321]</a>
Henry Prince of Wales, whom the poet makes his father
thus to disparage at the mere mention of Henry Percy's victory, would
lose nothing in point of prowess, and generosity, and high-minded
bearing, at this very early period of his youth, by a comparison
either with Percy himself, or with any other of his contemporaries,
whose names are recorded in history.</p>

<p>The next passage of our historical dramatist which requires to be
examined, occurs in that very affecting interview between Henry and
his father on the news of Percy's rebellion, and the resolution
declared to take the field at
Shrewsbury.<a id="notetag322" name="notetag322"></a><a href="#note322">[322]</a></p>

<p class="poem">
"I know not whether God will have it so,<br>

<p>The battle of Shrewsbury was fought July 21, 1403. The tragedian
represents Henry the Prince as at this period in the full career of
his unbridled extravagances; his father bewailing his sad degeneracy,
himself pleading nothing in excuse, praying for pardon, and promising
amendment. It must appear passing strange to those who have drawn
their estimate of those years of Prince Henry's youth from Shakspeare,
to find the real truth to be this. Not only was he not then in London
the profligate debauchee, the reckless madcap, the creature of "vassal
fear and base inclination," "the nearest and dearest of his father's
foes;" not only was he acting valiantly in defence of his father's
throne; but that very father's own pen is the instrument to bear chief
testimony to his valour and noble merits at that very hour. It is as
though history were designed on set purpose, and by especial
commission, to counteract the bewitching fictions of the poet. Henry
IV. was on his road to assist Hotspur and the Earl of Northumberland,
in utter ignorance of their rebellion. Arrived at Higham Ferrers, he
wrote to his council, informing them that he had received, as well by
his son Henry's own letters, as by the report of his messengers, most
satisfactory accounts of this very dear and well-beloved
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page355" name="page355">(p. 355)</a></span>
son
the Prince, which gave him very great
  pleasure.<a id="notetag324" name="notetag324"></a><a href="#note324">[324]</a>
He then directs
them to send the Prince 1000<i>l.</i> to enable him to keep his forces
together. This letter is dated July 10, 1403, just eleven days before
the battle of Shrewsbury. The King heard of Hotspur's rebellion on his
arrival at Burton on Trent, from which place he dates his
proclamation. Henry of Monmouth was appointed Lieutenant of Wales on
the 4th of March 1403; and he was with his men-at-arms and archers
there, discharging the duties of a faithful son and valiant young
warrior, when Hotspur revolted; and he left his charge in Wales, not
to revel in London, but only to join his own to his father's forces,
and fight for their kingdom on the field of Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>The extraordinary confusion of place and time, pervading the "Second
Part of King Henry IV," is only equalled by the mistaken view which
the writer gives of the character of Henry of Monmouth. News of the
overthrow of Archbishop Scrope is brought to London on the very day on
which Henry IV. sickens and dies; whereas that King was himself in
person in the north, and insisted upon the execution of the
Archbishop, just eight years before. The Archbishop was beheaded on
Whitmonday (June 8) in the year 1405. Henry IV. died March 20, 1413.
And instead of Henry, the Prince, being either at Windsor hunting, or
in London
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page356" name="page356">(p. 356)</a></span>
"with Poins and other his continual followers,"
when his father was depressed and perplexed by the rebellion in the
north, he was doing his duty well, gallantly, and to the entire
satisfaction of his father. We have a letter, dated Berkhemstead,
March 13, 1405, written by the King to his council, with a copy of his
son Henry's letter announcing the victory over the Welsh rebels at
Grosmont in Monmouthshire, which was won on Wednesday the 11th of that
month. The King writes with great joy and exultation, bidding his
council to convey the glad tidings to the mayor and citizens of
London, that "they (he says) may rejoice with us, and join in praises
to our Creator."</p>

<p>Thus does history prove that, in every instance of Shakspeare's
fascinating representations of Henry of Monmouth's practices, the poet
was guided by his imagination, which, working only on the vague
tradition of a sudden change for the better in the Prince immediately
on his accession, and magnifying that change into something almost
miraculous, has drawn a picture which can never be seen without being
admired for its life, and boldness, and colouring; but which, as an
historical portrait, is not only unlike the original, but misleading
and unjust in essential points of character.</p>

<p>It has been said, and perhaps with truth, to what extent soever we may
believe Shakspeare to have made "Europe ring from side to side" with
the vices and follies, the riots and extravagances, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357">(p. 357)</a></span>
young Prince, yet that he had spread his fame and glory far more
widely, and excited an incomparably greater interest in his character,
than history itself, however full, and however true in recording his
merits, could have done. The admirer therefore of the Prince's
character, who reflects on Shakspeare, is held to be ungrateful to
Henry's best benefactor; and, as far as his influence reaches, tends
to check the interest excited for the hero of his choice. But, whilst
he recalls with grateful reminiscence the enjoyment which he has often
drawn himself freely from the same well-head, the Author, in
attempting to distinguish between truth and fiction, would on no
account damp the ardour with which his countrymen will still derive
pleasure from these scenes of "Nature's child;" and he trusts that,
whilst he has supplied solid and substantial ground for Englishmen
still retaining Henry of Monmouth in their affections, among their
favourite princes and kings, his work has no tendency to close against
a single individual those sources of intellectual delight, which will
be open wide to all, whilst literature itself shall have a place on
earth.</p>

<p>In a little work, not long since published, intended to interest the
rising generation in the history of their own country, the preface
assigns as the author's reason for not coming down later than the
Revolution of 1689, "that, from that period, history becomes too
distinct and important to be trifled with." The doctrine involved in
the position, which is implied here, <i>that the previous history of our
country may be trifled with</i>, is so dangerous to the cause of truth,
that we may well believe the sentiment to have fallen from the pen of
the author unadvisedly. It is, however, unhappily a principle on which
too many, in works of far higher stamp
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page359" name="page359">(p. 359)</a></span>
and graver moment,
have justified themselves in substituting their own theories, and
hypotheses, and descriptive scenes, for the unbending strictness of
fact, thus sapping the foundation of all confidence in history. It is
not the poet only, and the fascinating author of historical romances,
who have thus "trifled with history;" our annalists and chroniclers,
our lawyers and moralists, often, no doubt unwittingly, certainly
unscrupulously, have countenanced and aided the same pernicious
practice. It is frequently curious and amusing to trace the various
successive gradations, beginning with surmise, and proceeding through
probability onward to positive assertion, each writer borrowing from
his predecessor; and then in turn, from his own filling-up of the
outline, furnishing somewhat more for another, who supplies at length
the whole historical portrait, complete in all its form and colouring.
Had the author above referred to not taken to himself practically in
the body of his work the indulgence which his latitudinarian principle
recognizes in the preface, he would not have so distorted facts in his
"story of Madcap Harry and the Old Judge," for the purpose of making a
pretty consistent tale,&mdash;consistent with itself, but not with the
truth of history,&mdash;to amuse children in their earliest days, at the
risk of misleading them, and giving them a wrong bias through their
lives.</p>

<p>In examining the alleged fact of Henry's violence and insults
exhibited in a court of justice, there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page360" name="page360">(p. 360)</a></span>
is much greater
difficulty than may generally be supposed, in consequence of the
entire silence of all contemporary annalists and chroniclers. Not one
word occurs asserting it; no allusion to the circumstance whatever is
found previously to the reign of Henry VIII, nearly a century and a
half after Henry V.'s accession.
   Hume<a id="notetag325" name="notetag325"></a><a href="#note325">[325]</a> asserts it on the authority
of Hall; and Hall has exaggerated the alleged facts most egregiously,
and most unjustifiably. Whether the fact took place, and, if it did,
what were the time, the place, and the circumstances, the reader must
judge for himself. The present treatise professes only to bring
together the evidences on all sides fairly.</p>

<p>It has been already stated that no historian or chronicler, (whose
work is now in existence and known,) for nearly one hundred and fifty
years, has ever alluded to the transaction. The first writer in whom
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page361" name="page361">(p. 361)</a></span>
it is found is Sir Thomas Elliott (or Elyot), who, in a work
called The Governour, dedicated to Henry VIII. about the year 1534,
thus particularizes the occurrence. Elyot gives no reference to his
authority.</p>

<p>"The most renowned Prince, King Henry V. late King of England, during
the life of his father, was noted to be fierce and of wanton courage.
It happened that one of his servants, whom he well favoured, was, for
felony by him committed, arraigned at the King's Bench. Whereof the
Prince being advertised, and incensed by light persons about him, in
furious rage came hastily to the bar, where his servant stood as a
prisoner, and commanded him to be ungyved and set at liberty: whereat
all men were abashed, reserved [except] the Chief Justice, who humbly
exhorted the Prince to be contented that his servant might be ordered
according to the ancient laws of this realm; or, if he would have him
saved from the rigour of the laws, that he should obtain, if he might,
from the King his father his gracious pardon, whereby no law or
justice should be derogate. With which answer the Prince nothing
appeased, but rather more inflamed, endeavoured himself to take away
his servant. The Judge, considering the perilous example and
inconvenience that might thereby issue, with a valiant spirit and
courage commanded the Prince upon his allegiance to leave the prisoner
and depart his way. With which commandment the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page362" name="page362">(p. 362)</a></span>
Prince being
set all in a fury, all chafed and in a terrible manner came up to the
place of judgment, men thinking that he would have slain the Judge, or
have done to him some damage; but the Judge, sitting still without
moving, declaring the majesty of the King's place of judgment, and
with an assured and bold countenance, had to the Prince these words
following: 'Sir, remember yourself: I keep here the place of the King
your sovereign lord and father, to whom ye owe double obedience;
wherefore eftsoons in his name I charge you desist of your wilfulness
and unlawful enterprise, and from henceforth give good example to
those which hereafter shall be your proper subjects. And now, for your
contempt and disobedience, go you to the prison of the King's Bench,
whereunto I commit you; and remain ye there prisoner until the
pleasure of the King your father be further known.' With which words
being abashed, and also wondering at the marvellous gravity of that
worshipful Justice, the noble Prince laying his weapon apart, doing
reverence, departed; and went to the King's Bench, as he was
commanded. Whereat his servants disdaining, came and showed the King
all the whole affair. Whereat he awhile studying, after as a man all
ravished with gladness, holding his hands and eyes up towards heaven
abraided, saying with a loud voice, 'O merciful God, how much am I
above other men bound to your infinite goodness,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page363" name="page363">(p. 363)</a></span>
specially
that ye have given me a Judge who feareth not to minister justice, and
also a son who can suffer semblably, and obey justice!'"</p>

<p>Sir John
Hawkins,<a id="notetag326" name="notetag326"></a><a href="#note326">[326]</a>
when he cites this passage as evidence of an
ebullition of wanton insolence and unrestrained impetuosity, in
illustration of the character of Henry, to whom he ascribes the
unjustifiable suppression of an act of parliament, lays himself open
to blame in more points than one. In the first place, he ought not, as
regards the suppression of an act of parliament, to have charged upon
Henry, as a self-willed act, what, to say the very least, was equally
the act of the whole Privy Council; and then he ought not to have
endeavoured to brand him with disgrace on the testimony of a witness
who wrote nearly a century and a half after the asserted event.</p>

<p>Hall, who wrote only at the commencement of the reign of Edward VI,
(the first edition of his work having appeared in 1548,) thus states
the charge against Henry:</p>

<p>"For imprisonment of
one<a id="notetag327" name="notetag327"></a><a href="#note327">[327]</a>
of his wanton mates and unthrifty
playfaires, he strake the Chief Justice with his fist on his face; for
which offence he was not only committed to streight prison, but also
of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page364" name="page364">(p. 364)</a></span>
father put out of the Privy Council and banished the
court, and his brother Thomas Duke of Clarence elected president of
the King's counsail, to his great displeasure and open reproach."</p>

<p>Perhaps it might be argued without unfairness, that the great
variation and discrepancy in the traditions respecting this affair in
the Prince's life would induce us to believe that, at all events,
something of the kind actually took place; that, without some
foundation in real fact, so extraordinary a transaction could never
have been invented; that, whatever difficulty we may find in filling
up the outline, the broad reality of an insolent and violent bearing
shown by the Prince to a Judge on the bench ought to be admitted; and
that any variation as to the person of the Judge, or the court over
which he presided, or the time at which the incident might have taken
place, or the degree of insult and personal violence exhibited, is
unessential, and proves only the inaccuracy in detail of various
accounts, all of which combine, independently of those minute
circumstances, to establish the main point. To this argument it might
also be added, that the very circumstance of an inspection of original
documents presenting names of real living persons, identically the
same with those which Shakspeare has given to the minor heroes of his
drama, (such as Bardolf, Pistol, &amp;c.) intimates a knowledge on his
part of the transactions of those times which entitles him to a higher
degree of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page365" name="page365">(p. 365)</a></span>
credit, as seeming to imply that he might have had
recourse to documents which are now lost:</p>

<p class="poem">
"Sir, Here comes the nobleman who committed the
Prince for striking him about <span class="smcap">Bardolf</span>."</p>
<p class="left50 p0t">
<span class="smcap">2 Hen. IV.</span>act. i.</p>


<p>On the other side, it might with equal, perhaps with greater fairness
be argued, that this is not one of those cases in which various
independent authorities bear separate testimony to one important fact;
whilst minor discrepancies as to time and place, and persons and
circumstances, tend only to confirm the testimony, placing the
authority above suspicion, and exempting the case from all idea of
conspiring witnesses. Such arguments are then only sound when the
witnesses are contemporary with the fact, or live soon after its
alleged date. But when chroniclers and biographers, who write
immediately of the times and of the life of the person charged,
recording circumstances far less important and characteristic, omit
all mention whatever of an event which must have been notorious to
all,&mdash;but of which no trace whatever can be found, nor any allusion
directly or indirectly to it is discovered, for more than a century
and a quarter after the death of the accused,&mdash;the investigator
appears to be justified in requiring some auxiliary evidence; at all
events, such discrepancies cease to contribute the alleged aid to the
establishment of the main fact. When, for example, the Chronicle of
London records an affray in East-Cheap between the townsmen and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page366" name="page366">(p. 366)</a></span>
Princes,<a id="notetag328" name="notetag328"></a><a href="#note328">[328]</a>
mentioning by name Thomas and John, and
registers the journeys of John of Gaunt, the execution of Rhys Duy,
the Welshman, with unnumbered events, far less important and notorious
than must have been the commitment to prison of the heir-apparent of
the throne, and on that circumstance is altogether silent, not having
the slightest allusion to anything of the kind; and when those
biographers who lived and wrote nearest to the time (such as Elmham,
Livius, Otterbourne, Hardyng, Walsingham, all of whom speak more or
less strongly of his irregularities and youthful vices, and subsequent
reformation,) never allude to any story of the sort, and apparently
had no knowledge even of any tradition respecting it; the charge
either of partiality or incredulity does not seem to lie at the door
of any one who might doubt the reality of the whole. It is not as
though the deed were regarded as having fixed an indelible stain on
the Prince's memory, and therefore his partial biographers would
gladly have buried it in oblivion. Sir Thomas
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page367" name="page367">(p. 367)</a></span>
Elyot (and his
seems to have been the general opinion) appears to have considered the
issue of the transaction as far more redounding to the Prince's
honour, than its progress stamped him with disgrace; and he attracts
the reader's especial attention to it by a marginal note: "A good
Judge, a good Prince, a good King." It is curious to observe the
progress of this story. Sir Thomas Elyot, the first in point of time
who states it, makes no mention either "of the blow on the Chief
Justice's face with his fist," or the removal of the Prince from the
council, and the substitution of his brother. Hall, on whom Hume
builds, adds both those facts; and then Hume in his turn proceeds to
affirm that his father, during the <i>latter years</i> of his life, had
excluded him <i>from all share in public business</i>. Had Hume examined
the original documents for himself, instead of building only upon
"printed accounts" of later date by more than a century, he could not
have fallen into this error. But a refutation of this mistake, only
incidental to our present question, belonged to another part of this
work, where it may be found in its chronological order. To the
ancillary argument drawn from the names of Henry's supposed reckless
companions in Shakspeare occurring in the records of real history, it
may be answered, that if that fact proved anything, it proves too
much. If, indeed, men of those names were found in Henry's company, as
Prince of Wales, either in London, in Wales, or in Calais, and were
afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page368" name="page368">(p. 368)</a></span>
lost sight of, or seen only in obscurity and
separate from him, that fact might be regarded as confirmatory of the
popular tradition. But the reality is otherwise. The names of Pistol
and Bardolf<a id="notetag329" name="notetag329"></a><a href="#note329">[329]</a>
are found among those who accompanied the King in his
careers of victory in France: and in the very year before Henry's
death (a fact hitherto unnoticed by historians) William Bardolf was
one of the Barons of the Cinque Ports, and Lieutenant of Calais; a
post which he appears to have held for some years with great credit,
and enjoying the royal favour and confidence. William Bardolf had been
employed ten years before by Henry IV, as one of the commissioners
appointed to treat with the Duke of
Burgundy.<a id="notetag330" name="notetag330"></a><a href="#note330">[330]</a></p>

<p>It is a curious fact, that the magnanimous conduct of the Judge,
tending so much to his renown, has induced various families and
biographers to challenge
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page369" name="page369">(p. 369)</a></span>
the credit of the affair for their
friends. No less than four claimants require us to examine their
pretensions. Shakspeare and the world at large have consented to give
the honour to Gascoyne; whilst the friends of Markham, Hankford, and
Hody, have each in their turn disputed the palm with him. Of these
four claimants two are reckoned among the "worthies of Devon." With
regard to Sir John Hody, "to whom some of our countrymen (says Mr.
Prince) would ascribe the honour," we need only add the sentence with
which this antiquary sets aside his claim,&mdash;"But this cannot be, for
that he was not a judge until thirty years afterwards."</p>

<p>The claims of Hankford to this distinction rest on the authority of
Risdon, the Devon antiquary, who began his work in 1605, and did not
finish it till 1630. Mr. Prince would add the authority of Baker's
Chronicle; but, were Baker's authority of any value, he does not
mention the name of the Judge; and, by specifying that the transaction
took place at the <i>King's Bench</i> bar, and that the Prince was
committed to the <i>Fleet</i>, he shows that no dependence is to be placed
on his authority. If it took place at the King's Bench bar, the King's
Bench prison would have received the royal culprit; and if, as Risdon
says, the Judge's sentence was, "I command you, prisoner, to the
King's Bench," not Hankford, but Gascoyne, was the Judge. Hankford was
not appointed to the King's Bench before March
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page370" name="page370">(p. 370)</a></span>
29th, 1 Henry
V, some days after the supposed culprit had ascended the
throne.<a id="notetag331" name="notetag331"></a><a href="#note331">[331]</a></p>

<p>The claim of Judge Markham, it is presumed, is supported only by the
testimony of an ancient manuscript preserved in his family. He was
Chief Justice
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page371" name="page371">(p. 371)</a></span>
of the Common Pleas from 20 Richard II. to 9
Henry IV.<a id="notetag332" name="notetag332"></a><a href="#note332">[332]</a>
Some colour, however, is given to this claim by the
vague tradition that Prince Henry was committed to the Fleet; to which
prison alone the Judges of the Common Pleas commit their prisoners.
But if he was the Judge who committed the Prince, and if he died in
the 9th of
Henry IV,<a id="notetag333" name="notetag333"></a><a href="#note333">[333]</a>
the allegation that the Prince was then
dismissed from the council falls to the ground; for at that time, and
long after, he seems to have been in the very zenith of his power.</p>

<p>If, then, Prince Henry was ever guilty of the gross insult and
violence in a court of justice, and the firm, intrepid Judge, to
uphold and vindicate the majesty of the law, committed him to prison
for the offence, the probabilities preponderate in favour of Gascoyne
having been the individual. But this supposition also is not free from
difficulties. He was made Chief Justice of the King's
Bench<a id="notetag334" name="notetag334"></a><a href="#note334">[334]</a>
15th
November, 2 Henry IV. (1401.) And of his
intrepidity<a id="notetag335" name="notetag335"></a><a href="#note335">[335]</a>
in the
discharge of that office, we have already
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page372" name="page372">(p. 372)</a></span>
mentioned an
especial instance at the death of Archbishop Scrope, if what Clemens
Maydestone, a contemporary, says, be true. Henry IV, who had the
person of the Archbishop in his power, called upon Gascoyne, who was
with him, to pass on his prisoner the sentence of death; but, at the
risk of losing the King's favour and his own appointment, he
positively refused, on the ground of its illegality. The Archbishop,
however, was condemned to be beheaded by one Fulthorp, (or, as some
say, Fulford,) afterwards a judge, as we have stated in its place.
Gascoyne was subsequently sent with Lord Ross, by the council, to the
north, as one of those in whom the King was known to have especial
confidence, as soon as the news arrived in London of Lord Bardolf's
hostile movement; and we find him still continued in the office of
Chief Justice, apparently without having incurred the King's
displeasure.</p>

<p>No adage is more sound than that which affirms a little learning to be
a dangerous thing. More than fifty years ago, the Gentleman's
Magazine<a id="notetag336" name="notetag336"></a><a href="#note336">[336]</a>
triumphantly maintained, that, at all events, Shakspeare
had deviated from history in bringing Henry V.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page373" name="page373">(p. 373)</a></span>
and Gascoyne
together after the Prince's accession, because Gascoyne died in the
life-time of Henry IV. This view has generally been acquiesced in, and
the powerfully delineated scene of our great dramatist has been
pronounced altogether the groundless fiction of an event which could
not by possibility have transpired. The whole question turns upon the
date of Gascoyne's death. He was buried in Harewood Church in
Yorkshire; and Fuller gives the following as his monumental
inscription: "Gulielmus Gascoyne, Die Dominica, 17<sup>o</sup> Dec<sup>ris</sup>. 1412, 14
H. IV."&mdash;"William Gascoyne [died] on Sunday, December 17th, 1412, in
the fourteenth year of Henry IV." If this were correct, there would be
an end of the question; but the brass was torn from the tomb during
the civil wars, and the copy cannot be verified. The inscription,
however, as given by Fuller, is at all events self-contradictory. The
17th of December fell on a Saturday, not on a Sunday, in 1412.</p>

<p>The process of the argument, and the accession of new evidence by
which we are now at length enabled to set this point at rest, are very
curious. The Author, indeed, confesses himself to have been one of
those who were induced, by the documents then before them, to believe
that Judge Gascoyne died on Sunday, December 17, 1413, somewhat more
than half a year after Henry V.'s accession; and although the late
discovery of the Judge's last Will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page374" name="page374">(p. 374)</a></span>
proves that the argument
was then sound only so far as it established the fact that he died
after Henry's accession, and was unsound in fixing the period of his
death at so early a period as December 1413; yet the statement of that
argument may perhaps not be altogether uninteresting, whilst it may
suggest a valuable caution as to the jealous vigilance with which
circumstantial evidence should always be sifted before the conclusions
built upon it be admitted.</p>

<p>It was then a fact upon record, that Chief Justice Gascoyne was
summoned, on the 22nd March 1413, (the very day after Henry's
accession,) to attend the parliament in the May following. When the
parliament met, Gascoyne's name does not appear among those who were
present; whilst Hankford, his successor, is appointed Trier of
Petitions in the room of Gascoyne, and, in the case of a writ of
error, brings up as Chief Justice the record from the King's Bench.
Hankford's appointment as Chief Justice bears date March 29th, 1413;
and he is summoned to attend parliament as Chief Justice in the
December
following.<a id="notetag337" name="notetag337"></a><a href="#note337">[337]</a>
In the Pell Rolls a payment is recorded, July
7, 1413, of his half-year's fee to "William Gascoyne, late Chief
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page375" name="page375">(p. 375)</a></span>
Justice of Lord Henry the King's father." The inference from
these facts was undoubtedly conclusive: first, that Gascoyne's death
was erroneously referred to December 1412; secondly, that he was alive
and Chief Justice when Henry V. came to the throne; thirdly, that he
ceased to be Chief Justice within eight days of Henry's accession,
somewhere between March 22, and March 29, 1413. It was merely matter
of conjecture whether he was too ill to discharge the duties of his
station, and resigned; or what other probable cause of his removal
existed. The conversation, at all events, which Shakspeare records,
might <i>possibly</i> have taken place; though it is a fact, scarcely
reconcilable with it, that Henry V. never did renew Gascoyne's
appointment,&mdash;a proceeding almost invariably adopted on the demise of
a sovereign by his successor. Henry V. might have offered to commit
into his hand "the unstained sword that he was wont to bear:"&mdash;within
eight days after Henry IV. had ceased to breathe, Gascoyne had no
longer in his hand the staff of justice.</p>

<p>The reason which then induced the persons who argued on these facts to
suppose that Fuller had by mistake adopted the date of the year 1412
instead of 1413 was this:&mdash;It was very improbable that the words "Die
Dominica" should have been introduced by the copyist, if they were not
really on the tomb. Hence it was inferred that he died on a Sunday.
Now December 17th was on a Sunday in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page376" name="page376">(p. 376)</a></span>
the following year,
1413; and, since the date was in Roman letters, it was thought very
probable that the last I had been obliterated in MCCCCXIII. The words,
indeed, "14th Henry IV," were also quoted by Fuller: but it was
unquestionably more credible that those words formed a marginal note
in the reporter's manuscript, and were mere surplusages, than that
they should have been allowed a place in the brass scroll of a
monument.</p>

<p>Such was the state of our knowledge, and such was the course of our
reasoning as to the time of Gascoyne's decease, till within a very
short period of the publication of this work. A document, however, has
been very lately brought to light on this subject, which supersedes
that statement altogether; setting the whole argument in a new point
of view, and reading a plain lesson on the care and circumspection
with which inferences, however plausible, as to dates and facts,
should be admitted. In the present instance, indeed, the conclusion to
which we had before arrived, on the question of Gascoyne having
survived Henry IV, remains unassailable, or rather, is only still
further removed from the possibility of historical doubt; and the
whole argument on the vast improbability of Prince Henry having ever
offered an insult to the Chief Justice, or of his ever having been
committed to prison for any offence of the kind, remains at least
equally strong as before. Most persons, perhaps, may consider the
degree of improbability
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page377" name="page377">(p. 377)</a></span>
to have become still greater. Be
this as it may, the facts now placed beyond further controversy as to
Gascoyne's death are these. In the Registry of the Court of York the
last Will and testament of William Gascoyne has been found recorded.
It bears date on the Friday after St. Lucy's Day in the year 1419; and
it was proved on the 23rd of December following. In the year 1419, St.
Lucy's Day, December 13, was on a Wednesday. The Will was consequently
made on Friday the 15th of December, and was proved on the morrow
week, Saturday, December 23rd. In the Will, the testator declares that
he was weak in body; and the strong probability is that he died on the
following Sunday, December 17,
1419.<a id="notetag338" name="notetag338"></a><a href="#note338">[338]</a>
This would accord precisely
with Fuller's representation of the scroll on the tomb, "on the Lord's
Day, December 17." Whilst the facility of mistaking MCCCCXIX for
MCCCCXII, (being the obliteration only of one cross stroke in the last
letter,) is even more remarkable than that of the error which on the
former supposition was thought probable, from the obliteration of the
last letter I in MCCCCXIII.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>The Author has had recourse to every means within his reach to assure
himself of the genuineness of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page378" name="page378">(p. 378)</a></span>
this document, and to ascertain
that the testator was the William
Gascoyne<a id="notetag339" name="notetag339"></a><a href="#note339">[339]</a>
who was Chief Justice
of the King's Bench. The result is, that not a shadow of any of the
doubts which he once jealously entertained, remains on the subject;
whilst he gratefully remembers the prompt and satisfactory assistance
rendered him by the present Registrar of York. The document must be
admitted without reserve.</p>

<p>From these now indisputable facts a thought might perhaps not
unnaturally suggest itself to the mind of any one taking only a
general view of the whole subject, that some countenance is here given
to the prevalent notion that Gascoyne had displeased Henry during the
years of his princedom; but that, instead of holding the worthy and
intrepid Judge in higher honour, (as tradition tells,) and rewarding
him for his noble bearing, on the contrary, the King resented the
insult shown to his person, and dismissed him (contrary to the usual
practice)
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page379" name="page379">(p. 379)</a></span>
from his high judicial station. A
fact,<a id="notetag340" name="notetag340"></a><a href="#note340">[340]</a>
however, new (it is presumed) to history, enables or rather compels us
to dismiss such a conjecture from our minds. Whatever was the definite
cause of Gascoyne's withdrawal from the bench as Chief Justice of
England; whether his declining health, or an inclination for
retirement and repose after so
long<a id="notetag341" name="notetag341"></a><a href="#note341">[341]</a>
and wearisome a discharge of
his arduous duties, or the
competency<a id="notetag342" name="notetag342"></a><a href="#note342">[342]</a>
of his fortune, induced him
to draw back at length from the turmoils of public life,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page380" name="page380">(p. 380)</a></span>
and
pass his last days among his own friends and relatives in the privacy
of a country residence; certainly he carried with him when he left his
court, not the resentment and unkindness, but the most friendly
feelings and respect of his new sovereign. By warrant, November 28,
1414, (that is, in the very year after his retirement,) the King
grants to "our dear and well-beloved William Gascoyne an allowance of
four bucks and does out of the forest of Pontefract for the term of
his life."</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>The sum of the whole matter as to the historical representations of
Henry's conduct is this:</p>

<p>Before the year 1534, far more than a century after Henry's death, no
allusion whatever is made to any occurrence of the kind in any work,
printed or manuscript, now extant and known. Sir Thomas Elyot, who
mentions it incidentally as an anecdote, combining the merits "of a
good Judge, a good Prince, and a good King," gives no reference to any
authority whatever. Subsequently it is reported in detail by Hall, but
with much exaggeration on Elyot's narrative. It then not only passed
current in our histories, but served as a topic of grave import in our
Prince of tragedians, and of burlesque in the broad farces of later
and perhaps earlier days than his. The biographers of Henry, though
they detail in all their minute particulars many circumstances of his
youth, far less important either to his character, or as facts of
general and national interest,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page381" name="page381">(p. 381)</a></span>
and who lived, some of them,
almost a century nearer the date of the supposed transaction than
Elyot, are to a man silent on the subject; not one of them betraying
the shadow of suspicion that he was even aware of any rumour or vague
tradition of the kind. Such facts as the committal to prison of the
heir-apparent, especially such an heir-apparent as Henry (it is
presumed), must have been notorious through the metropolis and the
whole land, and must have excited a great and general sensation; and
yet the Chronicles, though they often surprise us by their minute
notice of trifling circumstances, do not contain the slightest
intimation that any such affair as this had ever come to the knowledge
of those who kept them. They are silent, and their silence seems
natural.<a id="notetag343" name="notetag343"></a><a href="#note343">[343]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, most persons will probably believe that either Gascoyne,
or Hankford, or Hody would upon such evidence, we do not say merely
charge the jury for an acquittal, but would, on perusing the
depositions, have previously recommended the grand inquest to return
"Not a true Bill." Still every reader has the evidence fairly before
him, and must decide for himself!</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Should any one be disposed to think that questions of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page382" name="page382">(p. 382)</a></span>
this
sort might well be left undecided, and that the settlement of them is
not worth the trouble and research often required for their thorough
investigation, the Author ventures to suspect that, in the generality
of instances, such reflections originate in an inexperience of the
vast practical moment which facts, the most trifling in themselves,
often carry with them in the investigation of the most important
questions. Doubtless, the wise man will exercise his discretion in not
confounding great things with small; but, on the contrary, in stamping
on every thing its own intrinsic and comparative value. Still, in
great things and small, (though each in its own weight and measure,)
the truth is ever dear for its own sake, and should be for its own
sake pursued. And it must never be forgotten, that one truth, in
itself perhaps too minute and insignificant for its worth to be felt
in the calculation, when probabilities are being estimated, may be a
guiding star to other truths of great value, which, without its
leading, might have remained neglected and unknown. In itself, a false
statement, though generally acquiesced in, may be unimportant; in its
consequences, it may be widely and permanently prejudicial to the
cause of truth. If viewed abstractedly, it might appear like a cloud
in the horizon not larger than a man's hand; but that speck may be the
harbinger of wind and tempest. With regard, indeed, to those natural
appearances in the sky, the most experienced observer can do nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page383" name="page383">(p. 383)</a></span>
towards arresting the progress of the threatened storm; his
foresight can only enable him to provide himself a shelter, or hasten
him on his journey, "that the rain stop him not." In the case of
literary, physical, moral, religious, and historical subjects of
inquiry, (or to whatever department of human knowledge our pursuits
may be directed,) by rectifying the minutest error we may check the
propagation of mischief, and preserve the truth (it may be some
momentous practical truth) in its integrity and brightness.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Connected with the subject of this and the preceding chapter, problems
of very difficult solution present themselves, a full and
comprehensive elucidation of which would involve questions of deep
moral and metaphysical interest with regard to the structure, the
cultivation and training, the associations and habits of the human
mind. Upon the merits of those problems in their various ramifications
the Author has no intention to venture; and probably few persons would
pronounce unhesitatingly how far on the one hand the facts of past
ages (constituting a valuable deposit of especial trust) should be
kept religiously distinct from works of fiction; or on the other hand
how far the field of history itself is legitimate ground for the
imagination in all its excursive ranges to disport upon freely and
fearlessly: in a word, how far the practice is justifiable and
desirable of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page384" name="page384">(p. 384)</a></span>
bending the realities of historical record to
the service of the fancy, and moulding them into the shape best suited
to the writer's purpose in developing his plot, perfecting his
characters, and exciting a more lively interest in his whole design.
Whatever might be the result of such questions fully enucleated, the
Author, with his present views, cannot suffer himself to doubt that
society is infinitely a gainer in possessing the historical dramas of
Shakspeare, and the historical romances of Walter Scott. Instead of
putting the moral and intellectual advantages, the improvement and the
pleasure with which such extraordinary men have enriched their country
and the world in one scale, and jealously weighing them against the
erroneous associations which their exhibition of past events has a
tendency to impart, a philosophical view of the whole case should seem
to encourage us in the full enjoyment of their exquisite treasures;
suggesting, however, at the same time, the salutary caution that we
should never suffer ourselves to be so influenced by the naturalness
and beauty of their poetical creations, as to forego the beneficial
exercise of ascertaining from the safest guides the real facts and
characters of history.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX, No. I.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">OWYN GLYNDOWR's ABSENCE FROM THE BATTLE OF SHREWSBURY.</span></h3>

<p>Had Owyn Glyndowr joined the army of Hotspur before Henry IV. had
compelled that gallant, but rash and headstrong warrior, to engage in
battle, their united forces might have crushed both the King and Henry
of Monmouth under their overwhelming charge, and crowned the Percies
and Owyn himself with victory; but the reader is reminded that the
question for the more satisfactory solution of which an appeal is made
to the following original documents, is simply this: Did Owyn Glyndowr
wilfully absent himself from the fatal battle of Shrewsbury, leaving
Hotspur and his host to encounter that struggle alone, or are we
compelled to account for the absence of the Welsh chieftain on grounds
which imply no compromise of his valour or his good faith?</p>

<p>The first of the series of documents from which it is presumed that
light is thrown on this subject, is a letter from Richard Kyngeston,
Archdeacon of Hereford, addressed to the King, dated Hereford, Sunday,
July 8, and therefore 1403,&mdash;just thirteen days before the battle of
Shrewsbury. It is written in French; but the postscript, added
evidently in vast trepidation, and as if under the sudden fear that he
had not expressed himself strongly enough, is in English. "His
eagerness for the arrival of the King in Wales by forced marches, is
expressed with an earnestness which is almost
ridiculous."<a id="notetag344" name="notetag344"></a><a href="#note344">[344]</a></p>

of Glamorgan. It is addressed to John Fairford, Receiver of Brecknock.</p>

<p>Two other letters, which internal evidence compels us to assign to
this year,&mdash;the first to the 7th of July (two days only after John
Skydmore's), the second to the 11th of the same month,&mdash;carry on
Owyn's proceedings with perfect consistency. They were written by the
Constable of Dynevor Castle, and seem to have been addressed to the
Receiver of Brecknock, and by him to have been forwarded to the King's
council. "The first gives us no exalted notion of the Constable's
courage: 'A siege is ordained for the castle I keep, and that is great

the extent of force with which Glyndowr was then moving in his
inroads; when threatening the castle of Dynevor, he mustered 8240
(eight thousand and twelve score) spears, such as they
were."<a id="notetag348" name="notetag348"></a><a href="#note348">[348]</a></p>

<p>The first letter, written on Saturday, July 7, ("the Fest of St.
Thomas the Martir,") he seems to have posted off immediately on the
news reaching Dynevor that Carmarthen had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page389" name="page389">(p. 389)</a></span>
surrendered to
Owyn, without waiting to ascertain the accuracy of the report; for, in
his second letter, he tells us that they had not yet resolved whether
to burn the town or no.</p>

<p class="letter">
     "Dear Friend,&mdash;I do you to wit that Owyn Glyndowr, Henry Don,
     Rees Duy, Rees ap Gv. ap Llewellyn, Rees Gether, have won the
     town of Carmarthen, and Wygmer the Constable had yielded the
     castle to Carmarthen; and have burnt the town, and slain more
     than fifty men: and they be in purpose to Kedwelly, and a siege
     is ordained at the castle I keep, and that is great peril for me,
     and all that be with me; for they have made a vow that they will
     [al gat] at all events have us dead therein. Wherefore I pray you
     not to beguile us, but send to us warning shortly whether we may
     have any help or no; and, if help is not coming, that we have an
     answer, that we may steal away by night to Brecknock, because we
     fail victuals and men [and namlich], especially men. Also Jenkyn
     ap Ll. hath yielden up the castle of Emlyn with free will; and
     also William Gwyn, and many gentles, are in person with Owyn....

<p class="left50 p0t">
  <span class="smcap">"Jenkyn Hanard</span>,<br>
  "Constable de Dynevour."</p>


<p>In this letter the Constable says that Owyn's forces were in purpose
to Kedwelly: the second letter refers to Owyn's purpose having been
altered by the formidable approach of the Baron of Carew towards St.
Clare. This was probably on Monday, July 9, the third day after the
surrender of Carmarthen. The Tuesday night he slept at Locharn
(Laugharne). Through the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page390" name="page390">(p. 390)</a></span>
the
little garrison of Dynevor were negociating with him; for he was
resolved to win that castle, and to make it his head-quarters. On that
Wednesday, the Constable tells us, that Owyn intended, should he come
to terms with the Baron of Carew, to return to Carmarthen for his
share of the spoil, and to determine on the utter destruction of the
town, or its preservation. By a letter sent from the Mayor and
burgesses of Caerleon to the Mayor and burgesses of Monmouth,&mdash;the
propriety of referring which to this very year can scarcely be
questioned,&mdash;we are informed that the Baron of Carew was not so easily
tempted from his allegiance as some other "false traitors" in that
district; and that he defeated and put to the sword a division of Owyn
Glyndowr's army on the 12th of July,&mdash;the very day probably after the
date of the Constable's last letter. This fact, when admitted,
increases in importance; because it proves that as late, at least, as
July 12th, Owyn Glyndowr, though generally successful in that
campaign, was not without a formidable enemy there; and therefore by
no means at liberty to quit the country at a moment's warning, or to
leave his adherents without the protection of his forces and his own
presence.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Copy of the second letter from the Constable of Dynevor:</p>

<p class="letter">
     "Dear Friend,&mdash;I do you to wit that Owyn was in purpose to
     Kedwelly, and the Baron of Carew was coming with a great retinue
     towards St. Clare, and so Owyn changed his purpose, and rode to
     meet the Baron; and that night he lodged at St. Clare, and
     destroyed all the country about. And on Tuesday they were at
     treaties all day, and that night he lodged him at the town of
     Locharn, six miles out of the town of Carmarthen. The intention
     is, if the Baron and he accord in treaty, then he turneth again
     to Carmarthen for his part of the good, and Rees
Duy<a id="notetag350" name="notetag350"></a><a href="#note350">[350]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page391" name="page391">(p. 391)</a></span>
     his part. And many of the great masters stand yet in the
     castle of Carmarthen; for they have not yet made their ordinance
     whether the castle and town shall be burnt or no; and therefore,
     if there is any help coming, haste them all haste towards us, for
     every house is full about us of their poultry, and yet wine and
     honey enough in the country, and wheat and beans, and all manner
     of victuals. And we of the castle of Dynevor had treaties with
     him on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday; and now he will ordain for
     us to leave that castle, [for ther a castyth to ben y serkled
     thince,] for that was the chief place in old time. And Owyn's
     muster on Monday was eight thousand and twelve score spears, such
     as they were. Other tidings I not now; but God of Heaven send you
     and us from all enemies! Written at Dynevor this Wednesday in
     haste."</p>

<p>The despatch from the burgesses of Carleon, after stating that seven
hundred men, whom Owyn had sent forwards as pioneers and to search the
ways, were to a man slain by the Lord of Carew's men on the 12th day
of July, records an anecdote so characteristic of Owyn's superstition,
that, whilst examining his conduct, we may scarcely pass it by
unnoticed. He sent after Hopkyn ap Thomas of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page392" name="page392">(p. 392)</a></span>
Gower, inasmuch
as he held him Master of Brut, (<i>i. e.</i> skilled in the prophecies of
Merlin,) to learn from him what should befal him, and he told him that
he should be taken within a brief time between Carmarthen and Gower
under a black banner. [The Author finds the next sentence so obscure
that he leaves it to the interpretation of the reader.] "Knowelichyd
that thys blake baner scholde dessese hym, and nozt that he schold be
take undir hym."</p>

<p>In weighing the evidence brought to light by these original
despatches, it will be necessary to have a few dates immediately
present to our mind.</p>

<p>We have it under the King's own hand, that, when he was at Higham
Ferrers, he believed himself to be on his road northward to form a
junction with Hotspur and his father Northumberland, and together with
them (of whose allegiance and fidelity he apparently had not hitherto
entertained any suspicion) to make a joint expedition against the
Scots. This letter is dated July 10, 1403.</p>

<p>Five days only at the furthest intervened between the date of this
letter and the King's proclamation at Burton on Trent (still on his
journey northward) to the sheriffs to raise their counties, and join
him to resist the Percies, whose rebellion had then suddenly been made
known to him. This proclamation is dated July 16, 1403. Four days only
elapsed between the issuing of this proclamation and the death of
Hotspur, with the total discomfiture of his followers in Hateley
Field, where the battle of Shrewsbury was fought on Saturday, 21st of
July, the very week on the Monday of which he had first heard of the
revolt of the Percies.</p>

<p>If the dates relating to Owyn's proceedings,&mdash;some ascertained beyond
further question, and others admitted on the ground of high
probability, approaching certainty, with which the documents above
quoted supply us,&mdash;are laid side by side with these indisputable
facts, the inference from the comparison seems unavoidable, that Owyn
was never made acquainted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page393" name="page393">(p. 393)</a></span>
with the expectation on the part
of his allies of so early a struggle with the King's forces in
England; (indeed the conflict evidently was unexpected by Hotspur
himself;) that Owyn was in the most remote corner of South Wales when
the battle was fought; and that probably the sad tidings of Hotspur's
overthrow reached him without his ever having been apprised (at least
in time) that the Percy needed his succour.</p>

<p>This poem, "The Life and Death of Hector," was published after the
marriage of Henry with Katharine, and before her arrival in England.
Among its closing sentiments are the following, intended probably as
an honest warning to his royal master, that in the midst of life we
are in death, and that the messenger from heaven knocks at the palace
of the conquering monarch with no less suddenness than at the cottage
of his humblest subject. How appropriate was the warning! Henry did
not survive the publication of this poem more than a single year.</p>

<p>In the poem called the "Siege of Troy," written in different metre,
Lydgate, addressing Henry, "O most worthy Prince!
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page399" name="page399">(p. 399)</a></span>
of
Knighthood source and well!" thus proceeds to state the circumstances
under which he wrote his work:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="poem1">"God I take highly to witness</span><br>
That I this work of heartily low humbless<br>
Took upon me of intention,<br>
Devoid of pride and presumption,<br>
For to obey without variance<br>
<i>My Lord's bidding fully and pleasance</i>;<br>
Which hath desire, soothly for to sayn,<br>
Of very knighthood to remember again<br>
The wortheness (if I shall not lie)<br>
And the prowess of old chivalry,<br>
Because <i>he hath joy and great dainty</i><br>
To <i>read in books of antiquity</i><br>
To <i>find only virtue</i> to sow<br>
By example of them, and also to eschew<br>
The cursed vice of sloth and idleness;<br>
So he enjoyeth in <i>virtuous</i> business,<br>
In all that longeth to manhood, dare I sayn,<br>
He busyeth ever. And thereto is so fain<br>
To haunt his body in plays martial,<br>
Through exercise to exclude sloth at all,<br>
(After the doctrine of Vigetius.)<br>
Thus is he both <i>manful</i> and <i>virtuous</i>,<br>
More passingly than I can of him write;<br>
I want cunning his high renown to indite,<br>
So much of manhood men may in him seen.<br>
And for to wit whom I would mean,<br>
The eldest son of the noble King<br>
Henry the Fourth; of knighthood well and spring;<br>
In whom is showed of what stock that he grew,<br>
The root is virtue;<br>
Called Henry eke, the worthy Prince of Wales,<br>

So I could, and write it for his sake;<br>
Because he would that to high and low<br>
The noble story openly were knowe<br>
In our tongue, about in every age,<br>
And written as well in our language<br>
As in Latin and French it is;<br>
That of the story the truth we not miss,<br>
No more than doth each other nation;<br>
This was the fine of his intention.<br>
The which emprise anon I 'gin shall<br>

It was the year, soothly to sayn,<br>

only the second year after the death of Constance, and seems to
have excited among the nobility equal surprise and disgust. "The

Gloucester, &amp;c. disdained that she should be matched with the
Duke of Lancaster, and by that means accounted second person in

<b>Footnote 9:</b> In this same year Bolinbroke's life was put into
imminent peril during the insurrection headed by Wat Tiler. The
rebels broke into the Tower of London, though it was defended by
some brave knights and soldiers; seized and murdered the
Archbishop and others; and, carrying the heads of their victims
on pikes, proceeded in a state of fury to John of Gaunt's palace
at the Savoy, which they utterly destroyed and burnt to the
ground. Gaunt himself was in the North: but his son Bolinbroke
was in the Tower of London, and owed his life to the
interposition of one John Ferrour of Southwark. This is a fact
not generally known to historians; and since the document which
records it, bears testimony to Bolinbroke's spirit of gratitude,
it will not be thought out of place to allude to it here. This
same John Ferrour, with Sir Thomas Blount and others, was tried
in the Castle of Oxford for high treason, in the first year of
Henry IV. Blount and the others were condemned and executed; but
to John Ferrour a free pardon, dated Monday after the Epiphany,
was given, "our Lord the King remembering that in the reign of
Richard the Second, during the insurrection of the Counties of
Essex and Kent, the said John saved the King's life in the midst
of that commonalty, in a wonderful and kind manner, whence the
King happily remains alive unto this day. For since every good
whatever naturally and of right requires another good in return,
the King of his especial grace freely pardons the said John."

<b>Footnote 21:</b> The Author would gladly have presented to the
reader a different portrait of the religious and moral character
of "Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster;" but a careful
examination of the testimony of his enemies and of his eulogists,
as well as of the authentic documents of his own household, seems
to leave no other alternative, short of the sacrifice of truth.
Godwin, in his Life of Chaucer, has undertaken his defence, but
on such unsound principles of morality as must be reprobated by
every true lover of Religion and Virtue. The same domestic
register of the Duchy which records the wages paid to the
adulteress, and the duke's losses by gambling, proves (as many
other family accounts would prove) that no fortune however
princely can supply the unbounded demands of profligacy and
dissipation. Even John of Gaunt, with his immense possessions,
was driven to borrow money. This fact is accompanied in the
record by the curious circumstance, that an order is given for
the employment of three or four stout yeomen, because of the
danger of the road, to guard the bearers of a loan made by the
Earl of Arundel to the Duke, and sent from Shrewsbury to London.

<b>Footnote 28:</b> The Author trusts to be pardoned, if he suffers
these conjectures on Henry's studies in Oxford to tempt him to
digress in this note further than the strict rules of unity might
approve. They brought a lively image to his mind of the
occupations and confessions of one of the earliest known sons of
Alma Mater. Perhaps Ingulphus is the first upon record who,
having laid the foundation of his learning at Westminster,
proceeded for its further cultivation to Oxford. From the
biographical sketch of his own life, we learn that he was born of
English parents and a native of the fair city of London. Whilst a
schoolboy at Westminster, he was so happy as to have interested
in his behalf Egitha, daughter of Earl Godwin, and queen of
Edward the Confessor. He describes his patroness as a lady of
great beauty, well versed in literature, of most pure chastity
and exalted moral feeling, together with pious humbleness of
mind, tainted by no spot of her father's or her brother's
barbarism, but mild and modest, honest and faithful, and the
enemy of no human being. In confirmation of his estimate of her
excellence, he quotes a Latin verse current in his day, not very
complimentary to her sire: "As a thorn is the parent of the rose,
so was Godwin of Egitha." I have often seen her (he continues)
when I have been visiting my father in the palace. Many a time,
as she met me on my return from school, would she examine me in
my scholarship and verses; and turning with the most perfect
familiarity from the solidity of grammar to the playfulness of
logic, in which she was well skilled, when she had caught me and
held me fast by some subtle chain, she would always direct her
maid to give me three or four pieces of money, and sending me off
to the royal refectory would dismiss me after my refreshment." It
is possible that many of our fair countrywomen in the highest
ranks now, are not aware that, more than eight hundred years ago,
their fair and noble predecessors could play with a Westminster
scholar in grammar, verses, and logic. Egitha left behind her an
example of high religious, moral, and literary worth, by
imitating which, not perhaps in its literal application, but
certainly in its spirit, the noble born among us will best uphold
and adorn their high station. Ingulphus (in the very front of
whose work the Author thinks he sees the stamp of raciness and
originality, though he cannot here enter into the question of its
genuineness) tells us then, how he made proficiency beyond many
of his equals in mastering the doctrines of Aristotle, and
covered himself to the very ankles in Cicero's Rhetoric. But,
alas, for the vanity of human nature! His confession here might
well suggest reflections of practical wisdom to many a young man
who may be tempted, as was Ingulphus, in the university or the
wide world, to neglect and despise his father's roof and his
father's person, after success in the world may have raised him
in society above the humble station of his birth,&mdash;a station from
which perhaps the very struggles and privations of that parent
himself may have enabled him to emerge. "Growing up a young man
(he says) I felt a sort of disdainful loathing at the straitened
and lowly circumstances of my parents, and desired to leave my
paternal hearth, hankering after the halls of kings and of the
great, and daily longing more and more to array myself in the
gayest and most luxurious costume." Ingulphus lived to repent,
and to be ashamed of his weakness and folly.<a href="#notetag028">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 29:</b> John Carpenter. This learned and good man could not
have been much, if at all, Henry's senior. He was made Bishop of
Worcester (not as Goodwin says by Henry V. but) in the year 1443.
He died in 1476; so that if he was in Oxford when we suppose
Henry to have studied there and to have been only his equal in
age, he would have been nearly ninety when he died. Thomas Rodman
was an eminent astronomer as well as a learned divine, of Merton
College. He was not promoted to a bishopric till two years after
Henry's death.</p>

<p>Among other learned and pious men who were much esteemed by
Henry, we find especially mentioned Robert Mascall, confessor to
his father, and Stephen Partington. The latter was a very popular
preacher, whom some of the nobility invited to court. Henry,
delighted with his eloquence, treated him with favour and
affectionate regard, and advanced him to the see of St. David's.
Robert Mascall was of the order of Friars Carmelites. In 1402 he
was ordered to be continually about the King's person, for the
advantage and health of his soul. Two years afterwards he was

will, he will be at home; he has friends in every country."</p>

him on his exile, not with music and song, but with sighs and
tears and lamentations; and that on Gaunt's death the people of
England "spoke much and loudly of Derby's return,&mdash;especially the
Londoners, who loved him a hundred times more than they did the
King. The Earl, he says, heard of the death of his father, even
before the King of France, though Richard had posted off the
event to that monarch as joyful tidings. He put himself and his
household in deep mourning, and caused the funeral obsequies to
be solemnized with much grandeur. The King, the Duke of Orleans,
and very many nobles and prelates were present at the solemnity,
for the Earl was much beloved by them all, and they deeply
sympathized with his grief, for he was an agreeable knight,
well-bred, courteous, and gentle to every one."

<b>Footnote 84:</b> Mr. Tytler, in his History of Scotland, maintains
with much ingenuity the paradoxical position, that Richard
escaped from Pontefract, made his way in disguise to the Western
Isles, was there recognised, and was conducted to the Regent;
that, taken into the safe keeping of the government, and sick of
the world and its disappointments, he lived for many years in
Stirling Castle; and that he there died, and there was buried. It
falls not within the province of these Memoirs to examine the
facts and reasonings by which that writer supports his theory, or
to weigh the value of the objections which have been alleged
against it. The Author, however, in confessing that the result of
his own inquiries is opposed to the hypothesis of Richard's
escape, and that he acquiesces in the general tradition that he
died in Pontefract, cannot refrain from making one remark. Whilst
he is persuaded that Glyndowr, and many others, believed that
Richard was alive in Scotland, yet he thinks it almost capable of
demonstration that Henry IV, with his sons and his court, in
England; and Charles VI, with his court and clergy, and Isabella
herself, and her second husband, had no doubt whatever as to
Richard's death. If they had, if they were not fully assured that
he was no longer among the living, it is difficult to understand
Henry IV.'s proposals to Charles VI. for a marriage between
Isabella and one of his sons; or how, on any other hypothesis
than the conviction of his death, the Earl of Angouleme,
afterwards Duke of Orleans, would have sought her in marriage;
how her father and his clergy could have consented to her
nuptials; or how she could for a moment have entertained the
thought of becoming a bride again. She had not only been
betrothed to Richard, but had been with all solemnity married to
him by the Archbishop of Canterbury in the face of the church;
and she had been crowned queen. Yet she was married to Angouleme
in 1406, and died in childbed in 1409. Had she believed Richard
to be still alive, she would have been more inclined to follow
the bidding which Shakspeare puts into her husband's mouth at
their last farewell, than to have given her hand before the altar
to another:</p>

<b>Footnote 90:</b> A manuscript in the French King's library (No.
8448) states that Sir Piers d'Exton and seven other assassins
entered the room to kill him; but that Richard, pushing down the
table, darted into the midst of them, and, snatching a battleaxe
from one, laid four of them dead at his feet, when Exton felled
him with a blow at the back of his head, and, as he was crying to
God for mercy, with another blow despatched him. This account is
supposed to be entirely disproved by the fact that, when
Richard's tomb was accidentally laid open a few years ago in
Westminster Abbey, the head was carefully examined, and no marks
of violence whatever appeared on it. (See Archæologia, vol. vi.
p. 316, and vol. xx. p. 284.) On the other hand, it is equally
obvious to remark, that, if Henry IV. did exhibit to the people
the body of another person for that of Richard, it was the
substituted body which was buried, first at Langley and
afterwards at Westminster. The absence, consequently, of all
marks of violence on that body, till its identity with the corpse
of Richard is established, proves nothing. But surely there is no
reason to believe that any deception was practised. There could
have been no motive for such fraud, and the strongest reasons
must have existed to dissuade Henry from adopting it. The only
object wished to be secured by the exposure of Richard's corpse,
(and it was exposed at all the chief places between Pontefract
and London,&mdash;at night after the offices for the dead, in the
morning after mass,) was the removal of all doubt as to his being
really dead. The false rumours were, not that he was murdered,
but that he was alive. Among the thousands who flocked to see him
were doubtless numbers of his friends and wellwishers, familiarly
acquainted with his features, many of whom, it is thought, must
have detected any imposture, and some of whom would surely have
been bold enough to publish it. Still, on the other hand, it is
suggested that a very short lapse of time after dissolution
effects so material a change in a corpse, that the most intimate
of a man's friends would often not be able to recognise a single
feature in his countenance. And certainly many of Richard's
friends remained unconvinced.<a href="#notetag090">(back)</a></p>

rumours. In the rebellion of the Percies it was asserted that
Richard was still alive in the Castle of Chester. In 1406 the
Earl of Northumberland (though he had charged Henry with the
murder of Richard), in his letter to the Duke of Orleans states
the alternative of his being still alive. And even Sir John

<b>Footnote 99:</b> Owyn and his brother Tudor were both examined at
Chester, September 3, 1386, during the controversy between the
families of Scrope and Grosvenor as to the arms of the latter;
and it appears from their own evidence that Owyn was born before
Sept. 3, 1359, and that his brother Tudor (who was slain in the
battle of Grosmont, or Mynydd Pwl Melin) was three years younger.

<b>Footnote 102:</b> Sir Henry Ellis, to whom we are deeply indebted
for his succinct and clear statement of the events of these
times, appears, in his introductory remarks on Lord Grey's
letter, to have overlooked the date of Henry IV.'s departure for
Scotland. He says: "Upon Henry's return, the Welsh were rising in
arms, and Lord Grey was ordered to go against them. It seems to
have been at this point of time that the letter was penned. It
was apparently written in the month of June 1400." But the King
did not leave London till towards Midsummer, and we have a letter
from him (on his march northward) dated York, July 4, 1400,
commanding the mayor and authorities of London to provide corn,
wine, &amp;c. for the King's use in Scotland, and as much money
as they could raise on his jewels. The writ in consequence of
this letter was issued July 12. Walsingham, indeed, says that
they seized the opportunity of the King's absence, and rose under
their leader Owyn. The King, on his return from Scotland, was at
Newcastle upon Tyne on the 3rd of September.

<b>Footnote 103:</b> At the back of this letter of Lord Grey to Prince

Lord Grey, probably the very epistle which the Earl says he had
received "from the greatest thief in Wales;" the few last
sentences of which, apparently written in a sort of jingling
rhyme, indicate the character of its author and the spirit of the
times. "We hope we shall do thee a privy thing: a rope, a ladder,
and a ring, high on a gallows for to heng; and thus shall be your
ending; and he that made thee be there to helpyng, and we on our
behalf shall be well willing." The conclusion of another letter
from the same pen, in defiance of Lord Grey's power, breathes the
feelings with which the Welsh entered upon this rebellion. "And
it was told me that ye been in perpose for to make your men burn
and slay in whatsoever country I be and am seisened in (have

it might too often have been dispensed with for a less impartial
mode of trial. Besides, among the many severe enactments against
the Welsh, the King, in 1400, had assented to an ordinance

ancient accounts mention the Earl of Northumberland's visit to
Glyndowr subsequently to his return from the flight into
Scotland, and that the French auxiliaries invaded England under
Glyndowr's standard long after the battle of Shrewsbury. It was
on the last day of February 1408, that Rokeby, Sheriff of
Yorkshire, compelled Northumberland and Lord Bardolf to engage
with him in the field of Bramham Moor, when the Earl fell in
battle, and Lord Bardolf died of his wounds. The Earl's head,
covered with the snows of age, was exposed on London Bridge. The
people lamented his fate when they recalled to mind his former
magnificence and glory. Many (says Walsingham) applied to him the
lines of Lucan:</p>

<b>Footnote 162:</b> Hardyng represents the variance between Henry IV.
and the Percies to have originated in three causes:&mdash;in their own
refusal to give up certain prisoners of rank who had been taken
at the battle of Homildon; in the King's refusal to let Sir
Edmund Mortimer pay a ransom; and in the displeasure which the
King had felt in consequence of an interview between Hotspur and
Glyndowr, which had excited his suspicions. A commission was
issued on the 14th March 1403, at the instance of the Earl of
Westmoreland, to inquire about the prisoners taken at Homildon or
"Humbledon."&mdash;Rym. F&oelig;d. The Pell Rolls acquaint us with the
great importance attached by Henry and the nation to this
victory, by recording the pension assigned to the first bringer
of the welcome news: "To Nicholas Merbury 40<i>l.</i> yearly for other
good services, as also because the same Nicholas was the first
person who reported for a certainty to the said lord the King the
good, agreeable, and acceptable news of the success of the late
expedition at Homeldon, near Wollor, in Northumberland, by Henry,
late Earl of Northumberland. Four earls, many barons and
bannerets, with a great multitude of knights and esquires, as
well Scotch as French, were taken; and also a great multitude
slain, and drowned in the river Tweed." This act of gratitude was
somewhat late, if the entry in the Roll records the first
payment. It is dated Nov. 3, 1405. At the date of this payment
Percy is called the <i>late</i> Earl, because he had forfeited his
title.

<b>Footnote 169:</b> The Pell Rolls, so called from the pells, or
skins, on rolls of which accounts of the royal receipts and
expenditure used to be kept, are preserved both in the Chapter
House of Westminster, and also in duplicate at the Exchequer
Office in Whitehall. The Author had every facility afforded him
of examining them at his leisure; and doubtless these documents
contain much valuable information, throwing light as well on the
national affairs of the times to which they belong, as on the
more private history of monarchs and people. This is evident to
every one on inspecting the records of any one year. But at the
same time they read a lesson, clear and sound, on the
indispensable necessity of constant care, and circumspection, and
sifting scrutiny, before reliance be placed on them as evidence
conclusive, and beyond appeal. The Author of these Memoirs
entered upon an examination of the original documents, fully
aware that the date of payment with reference to any fact could
never be adduced in evidence that the event took place at the
time the entry was made, but only that it had taken place before
that time. Thus, a debt due to the Prince, or one in command
under him, at the siege of a castle in Wales, or to tradesmen and
merchants for supplying the forces with provisions, or to
messengers sent with all speed bearing despatches to the castle
during the siege, might remain unpaid for several years. He was,
however, at the same time under an impression that the sum was
recorded on the day of payment; at all events, that payments with
reference to any insulated fact could not have been recorded as
having been made before that fact had transpired. In both these
points, however, he was mistaken. Payments were registered not
only long after the day on which they were made, but absolutely
<i>before the event had taken place</i> to which they refer, and which
could not have been anticipated by any human foresight. Thus, not
only is payment recorded as having been made to Hotspur nearly
five months after his death, and to the Earl of Worcester, twelve
weeks after he was beheaded, for expenses incurred by him in
bringing the King's consort from Brittany to England in the
January preceding, but absolutely the payment of messengers sent
throughout the kingdom to announce Henry Percy's death and the
defeat of the rebels near Shrewsbury, and to order all ferries
and passages to be watched to prevent the escape of the rebels,
is recorded as having been made on the 17th of July 1403, <span class="smcap">FOUR
DAYS BEFORE THE BATTLE TOOK PLACE</span>, and the very day on which the
King wrote to his council, informing them of the rebellion,
before he could himself possibly have anticipated the place or
time of any engagement, much less the successful issue of such a
struggle with the rebels. The fact is, these accounts were not
kept with the regularity of a modern banking-house; and the
entries of what may have been omitted were made at the audits,
from rough minutes and account-books. Thus mistakes as to the
date of actual payment probably were not rare. The Pell Rolls are
useful assistants; they must not be followed implicitly as
guides.

<b>Footnote 203:</b> A review of this "aged Earl's" behaviour, from the
first occasion on which he is introduced to our notice in these
Memoirs to the day of his death, supplies only a melancholy
succession of acts of broken faith. On the 7th of February 1404,
before the assembled estates of the realm, on receiving the
King's pardon for the past, he most solemnly swore upon the cross
of Canterbury to be true and faithful to his sovereign Henry IV:
he "swore also, on the peril of his soul, that he knew of no evil
intentions on the part of the Duke of York, or of the Archbishop;
and that the King might place full trust and confidence in them
as his liege subjects."

men that had the guard, and beheaded them on the brink of the

that Owyn should not keep it for his fortress." The Haye,
Abergavenny, Grosmont, Usk, Pool, the Bishop's castle and the
Archdeacon's house at Llandaff, with the cathedrals of Bangor and
St. Asaph, were all either in part or wholly victims of his rage.

without expressing any opinion beyond what he has offered in the

passed many of his last days at the houses of Scudamore and
Monnington, of his having been some time concealed in a cavern
called to this day Owyn's Cave, on the coast of Merioneth, and of
his having been buried in Monnington churchyard, are by no means

treaty had been made with the Duke of Clarence and other English,
who agreed to evacuate the country without making war; the Duke
of Orleans giving to them the Earl of Angouleme as a hostage, for
whose ransom the Duke was put to vast charges. Letters also are
preserved from the Duke to his chancellor, reciting that a large
sum was to be paid to the English, and in particular a hundred
crowns of gold were to be paid to John Seurmaistre, chancellor of
the Duke of Clarence, who was going to Rome on the affairs of the
Duke of Clarence. This bears date, Blois, Nov. 20, 1412. His
mission to Rome was, no doubt, to negociate for the dispensation
necessary to enable the Duke to marry his uncle's widow. In the
March of the next year, the same document acquaints us with the
present of a head-dress from the Duke of Orleans to that lady,

<b>Footnote 284:</b> It may, moreover, be very fairly conjectured that
the presence of the Prince at home was regarded by the people as
far too important at this time to admit of his leaving the
kingdom on such an expedition. It will be remembered that one of
the first requests made by the parliament on the accession of his
father was, that the Prince's life, and the welfare of the
nation, might not be hazarded by his departure out of the
kingdom; and subsequently, on his own accession, one of the first
recommendations of his council was that he would remain in or
near London. It is very probable that a similar wish might have
interposed, had he, and not his brother, been commissioned to
conduct the expedition to Guienne. Calais was so identified with
the kingdom of England that his residence there is no exception
to the rule.

ceased to be of the King's especial council. Members of that
board (as appears by various entries) were paid for their
attendance. In the Easter Roll, for example, of the previous
year, payment on that ground "to the King's brother, the Bishop
of Winchester," is recorded. The payment to the Prince is thus
registered: "To Henry Prince of Wales 1000 marks,&mdash;666<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i>

<b>Footnote 287:</b> Perhaps more importance than the reality would
warrant has been attached to the circumstance that the King on
this occasion went to Rotherhithe, as though he withdrew from his
son for safety to so unwonted and retired a place. It was not
unusual for Henry IV. to hold his council at Rotherhithe. A year
before this muster of the Prince's friends, the instructions
given to the Earl of Arundel and others on their embassy to treat
with the Duke of Burgundy for a marriage between his daughter and
the Prince were signed by the King at Rotherhithe. In these
instructions the Prince is mentioned throughout as though he and
his father were inseparably united in the issue of the
proceeding. "Till the report be made to the King <i>and</i> his very
dear son the Prince." "Our lord the King is well disposed, <i>and</i>
his very dear son my lord the Prince, to send aid." And Hugh
Mortimer, one of the ambassadors, was chamberlain to the Prince.

<b>Footnote 288:</b> Who were the inferior agents in this ungracious
and mischievous proceeding we have not discovered. Perhaps,
however, the Author would not be justified in suppressing a
suspicion which has forced itself on his mind, that, among those
who entertained no kind feeling towards the Prince, was Richard
Kyngeston, then late Archdeacon of Hereford, for a long time
employed in the King's household, and through whose
administration the expenses seem to have swollen very much; to
control which was one of the principal causes for the appointment
of the Prince, the Bishop of Winchester, and others, to be
members of the especial council of the King. This suspicion was
first suggested by the absence of all allusion to the Prince in
the Archdeacon's letters to the King from Hereford in the early
years of the Welsh rebellion, though Henry was close at hand; and
the very ambiguous expression, "Trust ye nought to no
lieutenant," when the Prince himself was virtually, if not
already by indenture, Lieutenant of Wales.

<b>Footnote 290:</b> Among the conjectures which may suggest themselves
as to the possible origin of the manuscripts' charge, that the
Prince sought to obtain from his father a resignation of his
crown, it might not be unreasonably surmised, nor would the
supposition reflect unfavourably at all on Henry's character,
that, finding his father to be in the hands of unworthy persons,
preying upon his fortune, misdirecting his counsels, rendering
the monarch personally unpopular, and bringing the monarchy
itself into disrepute, (of all which evils there is strong
evidence,) the Prince might have urged on his father the
necessity of again intrusting the management of the public weal
(which disease had incapacitated him from conducting himself) to
the hands of the same counsellors who had before served him and
the realm to the acknowledged profit and honour of both. The
Prince might, influenced only by the most honest, and upright,
and affectionate motives, have professed his willingness to
undertake the duties again from which he had (with his
colleagues) been as it should seem causelessly discharged. And
such a proceeding on his part might easily have been so
misrepresented as to constitute the charge contained in the
manuscript. The representations of Elmham, to which we have
already briefly referred, and which are confirmed by other early
writers, are so express with reference to these points, that they
seem to require something more than a mere reference in this
place. "When his father was suffering under the torture of a
grievous sickness, the Prince endeavoured with filial devotedness
to meet his wishes in every possible way; and notwithstanding the
biting detraction and manifold accusations of some, which
(according to the prevalence of common opinion) made efforts to
diminish the kind feeling of the father towards his son, the
Prince himself, by means of his own most affectionate kindness,
succeeded finally in securing with his father favour, grace, and
blessing, though those envious persons still resisted it."&mdash;Cum
idem pater gravissimis ægritudinis incommodis torqueretur, eidem
juxta omnem possibilitatem, totis conatibus, filiali obsequio
obedivit, et non obstante quorundam detractatione mordaci et
accusatione multiplici quæ (prout vulgaris opinio cecinit)
paterni favoris in filium moliebantur decrementa, ipse invidis
renitentibus, suæ piissimæ benignitatis mediis, apud patrem,
favorem, gratiam et benedictionem finaliter consequi merebatur.

Rapin to have sought for some evidence to support this
assertion?" Had he sought diligently, and reported honestly, such
a sentence as this could never have fallen from his pen. Carte
gives a very different view of Henry of Monmouth's court; and a
view, as many believe, far nearer the truth. "It was crowded," he
says, "by the nobles and great men of the land, when his father's
court was comparatively deserted."

<b>Footnote 300:</b> The Author has searched in vain for any

There is a copy in the British Museum, written up to a certain
point on vellum; the latter part, containing these sentences, is
on paper, and of comparatively a very recent date, transcribed,
as the Author thinks, not from a previous MS. of the Ypodigma,
but from a copy of the History. His ground for this inference is
the circumstance that the interpolation in the History, as to
Edmund Mortimer's death, which is not found in the printed
editions of the Ypodigma, occurs in this MS. The MS. on vellum,
preserved in the Heralds' College, is a copy of the History,
transcribed, as the Author conceives, by a very ignorant copyist.
The same interpolation of "Obiit" occurs here also; and, instead
of calling the person spoken of Edmund Mortimer, it has "Edmundus
mortifer." The Author was very desirous of comparing the original
copy of Walsingham's Ypodigma, as dedicated to Henry V, with
subsequent transcripts or versions. He entertains a strong
suspicion that the sentences here commented upon were not in the
original; but, in the absence of the means of ascertaining the
matter of fact, he reasons upon them as though they were actually
submitted to the eye of Henry himself.

<b>Footnote 304:</b> It is not within the province of these Memoirs to
record the Will of Henry IV, or to comment upon its provisions.
There is, however, one sentence in it, a reference to which
cannot be out of place here. In the year 1408, 21st January, a
Will, which to the day of his death he never revoked, contains
this sentence written in English: "And for to execute this
testament well and truly, for the great trust that I have of my
son the Prince, I ordain and make him my executor of my testament
aforesaid, calling to him such as him thinketh in his discretion
that can and will labour to the soonest speed of my will
comprehended in this my testament. And to fulfil all things
aforesaid truly, I charge my aforesaid son on my blessing." It
may deserve consideration whether this clause in a father's last
Will, never revoked, be consistent with the idea of his having
expelled the son of whom he thus speaks from his council, and
banished him his presence; and whether it may not fairly be put
in the opposite scale against the vague and unsubstantial
assertions of the Prince's recklessness, and his father's
alienation from him. It must at the same time be borne in mind
that the Will was made before the time usually selected as the
period of their estrangement. The Will, nevertheless, was not
revoked nor altered in this particular.

and dissipation. The same confession in his contemporary, Lord
Cobham, is hailed only as an indication of the work of grace in
his soul.&mdash;See Milner, Cent. XV. ch. i.

<b>Footnote 315:</b> Reference is here made to the creation of Henry as
Prince of Wales, not in anywise for the purpose of insinuating
that he would not have been raised to that honour by his father,
had he been the "desperate gallant" which the poet delineates,
but solely to show that the King's lamentation cannot be
historically correct. The poet, having fastened on the general
tradition as to Henry's wildness, gives rein to his fancy, and
would fain carry his readers along with him in the belief that
Henry had absented himself for full three months from his
paternal roof, and revelled in abandoned profligacy; whilst the
facts with which the poet has connected it, fix the outbreaking
of the Prince to a time when the real Henry was not twelve years
and a half old. Shakspeare's poetry is not inconsistent with
itself, but it is with historical verity.

<b>Footnote 316:</b> There are, however, other circumstances deserving
our attention, which took place, some undoubtedly, and others
most probably, within the three months preceding this very time.
In the first place, the Commons, who had at the coronation sworn
the same fealty to the Prince as to the King, on the 3rd of
November petition that the creation of Henry as Prince of Wales
might be entered on the record of Parliament; and on the same day
they pray the King that the Prince might not pass forth from this
realm, (in consequence of the movements of the Scots,) "forasmuch
as he is of tender age." In the course of that same month of
November 1399, a negociation was set on foot to bring about the
espousals for a future union of the Prince with one of the
daughters of the King of France. And about the same time
(probably within a month of the scene of Shakspeare which we are
examining,) the Prince makes a direct appeal to the council to
fulfil the expressed wishes of his royal father as to his
establishment, seeing that he was destitute of a suitable house
and furniture; whilst not a hint occurs in allusion to any
extravagance, or folly, or precocious dissipation, in any single
document of the time.

<b>Footnote 320:</b> We cannot read the document on which these
observations are founded without being reminded at how early an
age in those times the youth of our country were expected to take
up arms, and follow some experienced captain, or even themselves
lead their warriors to the field. When Hotspur accompanied his
father to the rescue of Berwick, he was only in his thirteenth
year; his father had borne arms from the age of fifteen; and
Henry of Monmouth (accompanied we know by a tutor or guardian, as
probably Hotspur was at Berwick) was certainly in Wales,
"chastising the rebels," soon after he had completed his
thirteenth year. Another reflection, forced upon the mind by a
familiar acquaintance with the political and the domestic history
of those times, is on the very low average of human life at that
period of the English monarchy. Few reached what is now called
old age; and persons are spoken of as old, who would now be
scarcely considered to have passed the meridian of life. It would
form a subject of an interesting, and perhaps a very useful
inquiry, were a philosophical antiquary (who would found his
conclusions on a wide induction of facts, and not seek for
evidence in support of any previously adopted theory,) to trace
the existence, and operation, and extent of those causes,
physical and moral, which exercise doubtless important influences
over human life, and, under Providence, contract or lengthen the
number of our days here. Unquestionably, such an investigator
would immediately find many changes adopted in the present day
conducive to longevity, in the structure of our habitations, the
nature of our clothing, our habits of cleanliness, our food,
comparative moderation in the use of inebriating liquors, with
many other causes of health now believed to exist among us. To
two causes of the average shortness of life, in operation through
that range of years to which these Memoirs chiefly refer, the
Author's mind has been especially drawn in the course of his
researches: one of a political character,&mdash;in itself far more
obvious, and chiefly affecting men; the other arising from habits
of domestic life with regard to one of our institutions of all
the most universally comprehensive,&mdash;a cause chiefly, but far
from exclusively, affecting the life of females. The first cause,
awful and appalling, is seen in the precarious tenure of human
life, during the violence of those political struggles which
deluged the whole land with blood. Those families seem to have
been rare exceptions, of which no member forfeited his life on
the scaffold or in the field; those houses were few which the
scourge of civil or foreign wars passed over without leaving one
dead. The second cause is traced to the very early age at which
marriages were then solemnized. The day of Nature's trial came
before the constitution had gained strength for the struggle, and
an awful proportion of females was thus prematurely hurried to
the grave; whilst the offspring also shared in the weakness of
the parent. Comparatively a small minority sunk by gradual and
calm decay; in the case of very few could the comparison of Job's
reprover be applied with truth, "Thou shalt come to the grave in
full age, as a shock of corn cometh in his season."

bearing upon the subject immediately in hand were selected and
placed in a room for his exclusive use. He never came. Shortly
after his work appeared: and, on one of the officers expressing
his surprise and regret that he had not paid his promised visit,
Hume said, "I find it far more easy to consult printed works,

<b>Footnote 331:</b> There is so much of fable mingled with the
traditionary biography of this "Devonshire worthy," that most
persons probably will dismiss the claim altogether. He became
weary of his life, and, being determined to rid himself from the
direful apprehensions of dangerous approaching evils, he adopted
this strange mode of suicide: having given strict orders to his
keeper to shoot any person at night who would not stand when
challenged, he threw himself into the keeper's way, and was shot
dead upon the spot. "This story (says the author) is
authenticated by several writers, and the constant tradition of
the neighbourhood; and I myself have been shown the rotten stump
of an old oak under which he is said to have fallen." But as to
the cause which drove him to this rash act the same writers vary,
and tradition is strangely diversified. One author says, that "on
the deposition of Richard II, who had made him a judge, he was so
terrified by the sight of infinite executions and bloody
assassinations, which caused him continual agonies, that, upon
apprehension what his own fate might be, he fell into that
melancholy which hastened his end." His re-appointment to the
office on September 30, 1401, by Henry IV, would have relieved
him from these apprehensions. Others say, that, "having committed
the Prince to prison in his younger days, he was afraid that, on
the sceptre of justice falling into his hands, that royal culprit
would take a too severe revenge thereof; and this filled him with
such insuperable melancholy, that he was driven to the desperate
act of self-murder." But his appointment to succeed Gascoyne as
Chief Justice of the King's Bench, March 29, 1413, must have
conquered that melancholy; and he discharged that office through
the whole of Henry V.'s reign, and through one year of Henry VI,
after which he died, December 20, 1422.
